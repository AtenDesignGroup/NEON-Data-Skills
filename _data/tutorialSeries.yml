  name: Intro to Raster Data in R Series
  description: "A series of data tutorials that teach you how to open, plot and perform
  basic calculations on raster data in R. It also covers key spatial attributes associated
  with raster data include extent, projection and resolution. Finally we cover dealing with
  missing and bad data when working with remote sensing imagery."
