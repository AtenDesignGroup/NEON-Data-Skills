  name: Intro to Raster Data in R Series
  description: "A series of data tutorials that teach you how to open, plot and perform
  basic calculations on raster data in R. It also covers key spatial attributes associated
  with raster data include extent, projection and resolution. Finally we cover dealing with
  missing and bad data when working with remote sensing imagery."

  name: Intro to Vector Data in R 
  description: "The data tutorials in this series cover how to open, work with and plot with 
  vector-format spatial data (points, lines and polygons) in R. Additional, 
  topics include working with spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference 
  system), working with spatial attributes and plotting data by attributes."

  name: Tabular Time Series Data in R 
  description: "The tutorials in this series cover how to open, work with and plot with 
  phenology-related micrometeorological data in R.  Additional topics include
  working with time and date classes (e.g., POSIXct, POSIXlt, and Date), 
  subsetting time series data by date and time and created facetted or tiles 
  sets of plots. NOTE: These lessons will be published SOON!"

  description: "In this series we cover the basics of lidar data including 3 key lidar data
  products - the Canopy Height Model, Digital Surface Model (DSM) and the Digital Terrain
  Model (DTM). We explore lidar point clouds using the free, online 3d point cloud viewer.
  Finally, we cover working with LiDAR derived rasters in R."

  name: Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data - (in R)   
  description: "In this series, we cover the basics of working with NEON hyperspectral remote
  sensing data. We cover the principles of hyperspectral data, how to open hyperspectral data
  stored in HDF5 format in R and how to extract bands and create rasters in GeoTiff format.
  Finally we explore extracting a hyperspectral - spectral signature from one pixel using R"
