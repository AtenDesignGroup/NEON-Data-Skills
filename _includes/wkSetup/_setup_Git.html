Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what
when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code
on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" >GitHub</a>. You will need a
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/" target="_blank">supported</a>
web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer
version 9 or above).

<p>

Install Git on Macs by downloading and running the most recent installer for
"mavericks" if you are using OS X 10.9 and higher -or- if using an
earlier OS X, choose the most recent "snow leopard" installer, from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/"  target="_blank">this list</a>.
After installing Git, there will not be anything in your
<code>/Applications</code> folder, as Git is a command line program. </p>
