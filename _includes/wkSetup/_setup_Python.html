<h3 id="Python-setup"> Setting Up Python </h3>

<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
scientific computing and data science, as well as being a great for 
general-purpose programming.  Installing all of the scientific packages 
individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend using an all-in-one 
installer, like Anaconda.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, **please make sure you install Python 
version 3.x** (e.g., 3.4 is fine, but not 2.4).

We will teach using Python in <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a>, 
a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will 
need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari 
and Firefox browsers are all 
<a href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>
(some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

<h4 id="Python-windows"> Windows </h4>

Download and install 
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>.
Download the default Python 3 installer.  Use all of the defaults for 
installation *except* make sure to check **Make Anaconda the default Python**.

<h4 Mac OS X </h4>
Download and install 
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>.
Download the default Python 3 installer. Use all of the defaults for installation.

<h4 Linux </h4>
We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
<a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
Download the installer that matches your operating system and save it in your 
home folder. Download the default Python 3 installer.

Open a terminal window. Type 

`bash Anaconda-`

and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.

Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When there is a colon at 
the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. 
Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to 
approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and press 
enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda 
distribution the default Python).

<h3>Installing ggplot Python package</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/yhat/ggplot">ggplot</a> is a Python
implementation of the R <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> graphics
package. It is not intended to be a feature-for-feature port of ggplot2 but
provides some of ggplot2 functionality in Python ecosystem.

The easiest approach to install ggplot is via conda package manager
provided in Anaconda distribution that you have installed above.

<h4 id="ggplot-windows">Windows</h4>
Open <em>Anaconda Prompt</em> from windows menu.

In opened prompt window type in

`<code>conda install -c conda-forge ggplot`
and accept when prompted for feedback.


<h4 Mac OS X</h4>

Open <em>Terminal app</em>.
Type into <em>Terminal</em> window
<code>conda install -c conda-forge ggplot</code>
and accept when prompted for feedback.


<h4 id="ggplot-linux">Linux</h4>
Open default *terminal application*
(on Ubuntu that will be <em>gnome-terminal</em>).

Type into terminal
<code>conda install -c conda-forge ggplot</code>
and accept when prompted for feedback.


<h3>Checking that your installation worked</h3>

Now it is time to make sure that your Anaconda installation was successful. Download
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/gh-pages/_includes/scripts/check_env.py">check_env.py file</a> 
which is a Python script that will check if Anaconda has been correctly installed on
your system. From your terminal, navigate to the directory that contains
check_env.py and execute the following: 
<pre>python check_env.py</pre>
If you receieve an AssertionError, it will inform you how to correct your
installation. Otherwise, it will tell you that your system is  good to go
and ready for Data Carpentry!
