<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">ESRI's ArcGIS Online mapping tools </a>
 allow for easy sharing of visualized data. You do need to have a license to 
create your own maps with these products. There are however, extensive public 
libraries online to browse maps created by others. 

The series of maps below focus on provisional data from early small mammal sampling 
and soils sampling at NEON field sites.

and

The first map below was created using small mammal data downloded from the NEON data 
portal. The last map represents soil N:P ratio derived using the NEON soil 
pit data.
