> Verifiability and reproducibility are among the cornerstones of the scientific
> process. They are what allows scientists to "stand on the shoulder of giants".
> Maintaining reproducibility requires that all data management, analysis, and
> visualization steps behind the results presented in a paper are documented and
> available in full detail. Reproducibility here means that someone else should
> either be able to obtain the same results given all the documented inputs and
> the published instructions for processing them, or if not, the reasons why
> should be apparent.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Summarize the four facets of reproducibility.
* Describe several ways that reproducible workflows can improve your workflow and research.
* Explain several ways you can incorporate reproducible science techniques into
your own research.

## Getting Started with Reproducible Science

Please view the online slide-show below which summarizes concepts taught in the
Reproducible Science Curriculum.

How reproducible is your current research?

<a class="link--button link--arrow" href="https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-intro/blob/master/checklist.md" target="_blank"> View Reproducible Science Checklist </a>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
**Thought Questions:** Have a look at the reproducible
science check list linked, above and answer the
following questions:

* Do you currently apply any of the items in the checklist to your research?
* Are
there elements in the list that you are interested in incorporating into your
workflow? If so, which ones?
</div>

## Additional Readings (optional)

* Nature has collated and published (with open-access) a special archive on the
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552" target="_blank"> Challenges of Irreproducible Science </a>.
* The Nature Publishing group has also created a
<a href="http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Reporting Checklist</a>
for its authors that focuses primaily on reporting issues but also includes
sections for sharing code.
* Recent open-access issue of
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.2016.v39.i4/issuetoc" target="_blank">Ecography </a>
 focusing on reproducible ecology and software packages available for use.
* A nice short blog post with an annotated bibliography of "Top 10 papers discussing reproducible research in computational science" from Lorena Barba:
