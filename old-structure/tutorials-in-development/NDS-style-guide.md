reference and testing. If you have user permissions on the NEONScience.org website
you can view it at neonscience.org/styles-css. Otherwise, use the text below to
guide the styling used in NEON Data Skills educational resources.

## Header at top of all tutorial pages

This header must be at the top of each tutorial so that all associated metadata 
will appear correctly. (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render)

## Rule

This is a rule (horizontal line) in markdown.

***

## Basic Markdown Highlighting

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when used
in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*. 

Write all headers in sentence case.  

# Heading one  
We don't use header one on the site. The title will be in header one but you 
don't code it. 

## Heading two
This level of header will show up in the table of contents on the side bar. It 
should only be used for large section breaks and use descriptive headers. 

### Heading three

#### Heading four

***
## Code in Text Conventions

To write code in a text section so that appears in code font, place a grave (`) 
before and after the desired code section. On a standard US keyboard, the grave 
is on the same key as the tidle (~). 

Functions are in a code font (`code font`) and followed by parentheses, like 
sum(), or mean().

Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font, without 
parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.

If you want to make it clear what package an object comes from, you should use the 
package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()`, or
`nycflights13::flights`. 

***

## GreyBox

This is the "Greybox" styling which contains the information on set up, data 
downloads, etc for the tutorial/lesson/workshop. 

The necessary div tag (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render): 

    <div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">  

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need the most current version of R and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded
on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **sp:** `install.packages("sp")`

<a href="/packages-in-r" target="_blank"> More on Packages in R </a>– Adapted from Software Carpentry.

### Download Data

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Field-Site-Spatial-Data.html %}

## Tutorial Series 
These capstone activities rely on skills learned in the 

* <a href="/primer-raster-data-R" target="_blank"> *Primer on Raster Data* series</a>,
* <a href="/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data - in R* series</a>, or
* <a href="/intro-hdf5-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) - Using HDFView & R* series</a>.
 
</div>

## Include Files

Include files are used for items/information that need to be to be repeated in 
many places (like the dataset above). By using an include an update can be made 
in one location and applied in all instances. 

In a .md file includes are added with the following code (space between { % and % } 
added so that this does not render).  

    { % include/wkSetup/_setup_data.html % }

where everything after "include" is the file path to the appropriate file. 

If you are creating content in Drupal (series overview, workshop, teaching module), 
these same includes can be used by using the appropriate node ID (space between square brackets
added so that this does not render). 

     [ [nid:6408] ]

It would appear like this: 

{% include/wkSetup/_setup_data.html %}


***

## Links

Because we want the ability to have links open on other pages, we only use
html code for links and not markdown code. 

#### External Link 

Code (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render): 

    <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank"> Adam Pritchar's Markdown cheatsheet</a>

<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank"> Adam Pritchar's Markdown cheatsheet</a>

#### Internal Link, using relative path

Code (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render):

    <a href="/primer-raster-data-R" target="_blank"> *Primer on Raster Data* series</a>

<a href="/primer-raster-data-R" target="_blank"> *Primer on Raster Data* series</a>

***


## Code chunks

### R


In Markdown code chunks look like this (indent only).


	 # add 1 +1
	 1+1
	 2

Notice in the above code `# add 1+1` should be highlighted as a comment, `1+1` 
should be highlighted as input, and `2` should be highlighted as output. All 
should be visually separate from the surrounding text. 




### Python 

However, we also have code in other languages too. Python currently looks 
like this in the Markdown. 

```python
#ls_dataset displays the name, shape, and type of datasets in hdf5 file
def ls_dataset(name,node):
    if isinstance(node, h5py.Dataset):
        print(node)
    
f.visititems(ls_dataset)
```


***

## Data Tips

Data tip boxes are used ot call out highlights that are useful, but beyond the 
scope of the lesson. Without the star and with a different descriptor, they can 
also be used in other cases. 

There should always be a space between the star and Data Tip.  

The div tag for this one is (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render): 

    <div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
    <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Here is a block with a data tip. 
Sometimes it might have some `code` in it. A data tip can include a list or
links, however, it cannot contain figures, etc. 
</div> 


***

## Challenge

Titles of Challenges should be H3 header and in sentence case. 

The div tag for this one is (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render):

    <div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">


<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Title of challenge
  
Here is some challenge text.

* it can have bullets
* another bullet

or 

1. a numbered list
2. or two 

some more text here

**bolding stuff**

*italicize stuff*

It can have multiple paragraphs too.
</div>


***

## Quote Blocks

    > Here is a quote block
    > you can use all sorts of different spacing and bullets in it too
    >
    > * list one
    > * list two
    > but you have to use a `>` on each line for it to work which is a pain.

> Here is a quote block
> you can use all sorts of different spacing and bullets in it too

***
## Images 
All images used in NEON Data Skills educational resources must be free of 
copyright issues (CC, CC-BY, etc). We provide the source of all image (linked
when possible). When feasible, we prefer to download and image and host it within
the /images/ directory it GitHub. This prevents broken images when links to external 
websites change. 

Images should be large enough to be useful on the website and in presentations
based on the educational resources. However, they should not be so large as to 
prevent usage of the educational resources in areas with slower internet connections. 
Image file sizes should not exceed 2 MB. Supported image types at this time are 
.jpg, .png, and .gif.
