This tutorial explains the structure of the NEON Ground Beetle Samplingdata and explains how to work with the 
combined data.  cleaning and combining the three tables from the 
NEON Data Portal related to Carabid Beetle data. This tutorial accompanies the 
<a href="{{ site.basurl }}/R/carabid-explore-data" target="_blank"> *Work with NEON Carabid Beetle Data* tutorial</a> 
which explains the structure of the data and explains how to work with the 
combined data. 

**R Skill Level:** Introduction - you've got the basics of `R` down and 
understand the general structure of tabular data.

## What Data Is Available
The carabid data that we will use for this tutorial were collected at 13 sites 
in 2014. NEON carabid data are stored in three tables: 
 * field collection data, 
 * sorting data and 
 * identification and pinning data. 
 
 Let's read in the data and explore it. 
 
 [**Note: Add brief bit about NEON file name conventions**]
ADD where documentation for all the fields can be found; ?same for all tables? 

* TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle Sampling
* TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle and Mosquito Specimen Processing
 
 **Note remove those packages not needed in this tutorial**

``` {r load-data}
# Load packages required for entire script. 
library(plyr)      # move/manipulate data
library(dplyr)     # move/manipulate data
library(maps)      # build maps
library(mapproj)   # work with map projections
library(foreign)   # Read data in XXXX format (why needed here?)
library(maptools)  # work with maps
library(raster)    # work with raster spatial data
library(graphics)  # base R graphics package
library(vegan)     # community ecology functions

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
# setwd("working-dir-path-here")

```

### Field Collection Data Table
Contains information related to the location of each trap (i.e., latitude, 
longitude, NLCD class) and metadata about the sampling event (i.e., when traps 
were set, `setDate`; the date of trap collection, `collectDate`; the number of 
days a given trap was in the field, `daysOfTrapping`). Unique collection events 
have a unique sampleID with the format = `plotID.trapID.collectDate`.

**NOTE: Katie are these your photos? If so, can we pull them down and store on our
site so they remain perminantly with the tutorial, also I'd like to add photo 
credit for them. **

### Sorting Data Table
This table contains information about what specimens were found in traps. Sample 
types include vertebrate bycatch (herps = `vert bycatch herp`; mammals = 
`vert bycatch mam`), non-Carabidae invertebrate bycatch (`invert 
bycatch`), and all information about carabids. 

Older data (2014 and prior) divide carabid data into two categories: 

* `common carabid`, for which all taxonomic and abundance data is listed in the 
sorting dataset, and 
* `other carabid`, a catch-all category indicating that the relevant taxonomic 
and abundance information for specimens with that `sampleID` is provided in the 
pinning dataset. 

Data since 2015 has all beetle data referred to as `common carabid` but on the 
data portal it will be `carabid`.  

Unique records have a unique `associatedSampleID` (format = 
`plotID.trapID.collectDate.taxonID.tubeID`). For records where taxonomic 
information is unknown the following shorthand codes are used in place of the `taxonID` [**NOTE: I added taxonID here, is that correct**] based on `sampleType`:

* `ib` for invertebrate bycatch, 
* `vb` for vertebrate bycatch, 
* `cc` for common carabid, 
* `oc` for other carabid.

### Pinning Data Table
Contains information about all carabids that were pinned or pointed. Each sample 
in the pinning dataset has a unique identifier (individualID). The information 
in the pinning table are traceable to the sorting data via the a sampleID. Every
'sampleID' in the pinning data matches an 'associatedSampleID' in the sorting 
dataset.

## Data Format
When downloaded from the portal, all data is divided by site. To look at all 13 
sites from 2014 will require downloading 39 files (one field, sorting and pinning 
data for each site) and combining the datasheets across all sites for each type 
of data (i.e., field, sorting and pinning). 

For an R script and information on how to clean and combine the numerous files 
from several field sites, see the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/R/carabid-clean-data" target="_blank"> *Clean & Combine Carabid Beetle Data from the NEON Data Portal* tutorial.

## Combined, Clean Data

However, for those that just want the csv files that are the end result, I have 
provided them [here](//github.com/klevan/carabid-workshop/blob/master/data/cleaned%20data/cleaned%20data.zip). 
Weather data from NOAA for these 13 sites can be found [here](//github.com/klevan/carabid-workshop/blob/master/data/NOAA%20weather%20data%20for%202014.csv).
 
## Explore the Data

```` {r read-data}
fieldData_HARV <- read.csv(
      file="cleanData/fieldData-cleaned.csv",
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
      )

sortData_HARV <- read.csv(
      file="cleanData/sortData-cleaned.csv",
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
      )

pinData_HARV <- read.csv(
      file="cleanData/pinData-cleaned.csv",
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
      )

```

### Field Collection 
A brief look at the data shows that most sites collect all 40 traps on a 14 day 
interval; 81% of traps were collected on the 14 day cycle exactly and 62% 
collected absolutely every trap during a collection bout. Deviations were 
minor and in more than 85% of cases, field operations staff were able to reach 
at least 8 of 10 plots.

``` {r exp-field-data}


par(mfrow=c(1,2))

hist(fieldData_HARV$daysOfTrapping,xlim=c(0,30),
		 col="black", 
		 main="Typical sampling interval", 
		 xlab="Days of trapping")
    
fieldData_HARV %>% 
	count(siteID,boutNumber) -> numTrapsDeployed

hist(numTrapsDeployed$n,xlim=c(0,40),
		 col="black",
		 main="Typical number of traps deployed",
		 xlab="Number of traps per site per bout")

```


## Trends and Patterns
Does latitude explain beetle abundance or richness? The relationship can be 
examined at the level of the trap, the plot or the site; but the pattern may be 
driven by substantial variation seen in the middle latitudes. 

``` {r plot-abund}
# plot beetle abunance 
plot(Dmap,
		 col="#ADA96E",bg='#77BFC7',
		 main='Beetle Abundance by Site',cex.main=3)

sites <- sites[order(sites[,'numCarabidsCaught']),]

sites$intensity <- heat.colors(13)[13:1]

sites$cex <- c(rep(1,4),rep(1.5,2),rep(2,4),rep(2.5,1),rep(3,1),rep(3.5,1))

points(sites$decimalLongitude,sites$decimalLatitude,bg=sites$intensity,cex=sites$cex,pch=21)

```

``` {r plot-richness}

plot(Dmap,col="#ADA96E",bg='#77BFC7',main='Beetle Richness by Site',cex.main=3)

sites <- sites[order(sites[,'beetleRichness']),]

sites$intensity <- heat.colors(13)[13:1] 
    
sites$cex <- c(rep(1,4),rep(1.5,2),rep(2,4),rep(2.5,1),rep(3,1),rep(3.5,1))
    
points(sites$decimalLongitude,sites$decimalLatitude,bg=sites$intensity,cex=sites$cex,pch=21)
```

### Plotting latitudinal gradients of beetle abundance and richness at the trap level

``` {r plot-lat-grad-trap}
    plot(bet_field$decimalLatitude,bet_field$beetleAbundance,xlab='Latitude',ylab='Beetle Abundance',pch=21,bg="darkblue")
    plot(bet_field$decimalLatitude,bet_field$beetleRichness,xlab='Latitude',ylab='Beetle Richness',pch=21,bg="darkblue")
```

### Plotting latitudinal gradients of beetle abundance and richness at the plot level

``` {plot-lat-grad-plot}

plot(bet_field_plot$decimalLatitude,bet_field_plot$beetleAbundance,xlab='Latitude',ylab='Beetle Abundance',pch=21,bg="turquoise")

plot(bet_field_plot$decimalLatitude,bet_field_plot$beetleRichness,xlab='Latitude',ylab='Beetle Richness',pch=21,bg="turquoise")

```

### Precipitation and beetle distributions

Precipitation was not homogeneous and largely fell in the southern and eastern US. Patterns of beetle abundance varied accordingly.

    plot(Dmap,col="#ADA96E",bg='#77BFC7',main='Precipitation by Site',cex.main=3)
    sites <- sites[order(sites[,'prcp']),]
    sites$intensity <- c(rep('white',3),rep('lightblue',3),rep('turquoise',3),rep('deepskyblue',2),'blue','darkblue')
    sites$cex <- c(rep(1,3),rep(1.5,3),rep(2,3),rep(2.5,2),rep(3,1),rep(3.5,1))
    points(sites$decimalLongitude,sites$decimalLatitude,bg=sites$intensity,cex=sites$cex,pch=21)

![Distribution of rainfall at across sites](//klevan.github.io/images/rfigs/neonCarabidby_site_rainfall_map.png)

    plot(bet_field$prcp,bet_field$beetleAbundance,xlab='Precipitation (mm)',ylab='Beetle Abundance per trap',bg='blue',pch=21)
    plot(bet_field_plot$prcp,bet_field_plot$beetleAbundance,xlab='Precipitation (mm)',ylab='Beetle Abundance per plot',bg='darkblue',pch=21)

![Effect of rainfall on measured beetle abundance](//klevan.github.io/images/rfigs/neonCarabidrainfall.png)

### Habitat and beetle distributions

NLCD class is an included variable describing the habitat in which traps are embedded. Habitat type certainly seems to influence observed abundance and (to a lesser extent) richness.

    par(mar=c(15,4.1,4.1,2.5))
    nlcd$color <- c('goldenrod',rep('darkolivegreen1',2),'darkolivegreen2','darkolivegreen3',rep('forestgreen',3),'darkgreen')
    barplot(nlcd$beetleAbundance,names.arg=nlcd$types,col=nlcd$color,ylab="Beetle Abundance",xlab="",las=2)
    barplot(nlcd$beetleRichness,names.arg=nlcd$types,col=nlcd$color,ylab="Beetle Richness",xlab="",las=2)
