This template should be used to start new tutorials. If your tutorial is in R 
or Jupyter Notebooks, or another format that will be converted to markdown. 
Please include the header above but create the tutorial in the appropriate 
application. 

To create a new tutorial, copy this template into the program of your choice. Save
the new tutorial in the /tutorials-in-development/ directory of your fork of the 
NEON-Data-Skills GitHub repo. When you are ready for review of your tutorial, 
complete a Pull Request to the NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills repository. If you
have questions on using a forking workflow in GitHub, please see there series: 
http://www.neonscience.org/version-control-git-series


If you are creating a series, workshop, or teaching module the "cover page" content
for this is created in a Drupal environment and must be created by NEON staff. 
Please create your content in a .md or Word-type document and email to 
neondataskills -at- battelleEcology dot org.

## Header at top of all tutorial pages

This header must be at the top of each tutorial so that all associated metadata 
will appear correctly. (spaces at beginning only added so as not to render)
