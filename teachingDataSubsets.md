The NEON Data Skills portal provides free and open materials that support the 
scientific use of large spatio-temporal data. These materials include subsets of 
data that are available for use in our self-paced tutorials, workshops, 
teaching modules or for instructors to use to design their own instructional 
activities. The data subsets are hosted on fig**share**. 

<a href="http://figshare.com/authors/NEON_Data_Skills_Teaching_Data_Subsets/834136" target="_blank"> NEON Data Skills Teaching Data Subsets fig**share** repository</a> 

The repository of teaching data subsets is managed by the Education department 
at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) in Boulder, Colorado.
