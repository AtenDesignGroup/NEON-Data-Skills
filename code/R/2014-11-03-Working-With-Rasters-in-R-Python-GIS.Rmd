###Getting Started
This activity will overview the key attributes of a raster object, including spatial extent, resolution and coordinate reference system. When working within
a GIS system often these attributes are accounted for. However, it is important
to be more familiar with them when working in non-gui environments such as 
 `R` or even `Python`.

In order to correctly spatially refence a raster that is not already georeferenced,
you will also need to identify:

1. The lower left hand corner coordinates of the raster.
2. The number of columns and rows that the raster dataset contains.
 
##Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions 
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel 
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the 
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. 
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in 
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell 
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel 
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>

    <figcaption>A raster at the same extent with more pixels will have a higher
    resolution (it looks more "crisp"). A raster that is stretched over the same
    extent with fewer pixels will look more blury and will be of lower resolution.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's open up a raster in `R` to see how the attributes are stored.

```{r View-raster-attributes }

#load raster library
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# Load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
DEM <- raster("DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  

# View raster attributes 
# Note that this raster (in geotiff format) already has an extent, resolution, 
# CRS defined
#note that the resolution in both x and y directions is 1. The CRS tells us that
#the units of the data are meters (m)

DEM

```


##Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a raster, represents the "X, Y" coordinates of the corners 
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell 
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel 
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like `R`, using supporting packages such as `rgdal` 
and associated raster tools have functions that allow you to view and define the 
extent of a new raster. 

```{r set-raster-extent }

# View the extent of the raster
DEM@extent

```



<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/raster2.png">
    <figcaption>If you double the extent value of a raster - the pixels will be
    stretched over the larger area making it look more "blury".
    </figcaption>
</figure>

###Calculating Raster Extent
Extent and spatial resolution are closely connected. To calculate the extent of a 
raster, we first need the bottom LEFT HAND (X,Y) coordinate of the raster. In 
the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in meters, to calculate
the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and rows to the X,Y corner 
coordinate location of the raster, multiplied by the resolution (the pixel size) 
of the raster.

Let's explore that next.

```{r create-raster }


#create a raster from the matrix
myRaster1 <- raster(nrow=4, ncol=4)

#assign some random data to the raster
myRaster1[]<- 1:ncell(myRaster1)

#view attributes of the raster
myRaster1

#is the CRS defined?
myRaster1@crs

#what are the data extents?
myRaster1@extent

plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")


```

We can resample the raster as well to adjust the resolution. If want a higher
resolution raster, we will apply a grid with MORE pixels within the same extent.
If we want a LOWER resolution raster, we will apply a grid with LESS pixels
within the same extent.

```{r resample-raster }

myRaster2 <- raster(nrow=8, ncol=8)
myRaster2 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster2, method='bilinear')
myRaster2
plot(myRaster2, main="Raster with 32 pixels")


myRaster3 <- raster(nrow=2, ncol=2)
myRaster3 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster3, method='bilinear')
myRaster3
plot(myRaster3, main="Raster with 4 pixels")

myRaster4 <- raster(nrow=1, ncol=1)
myRaster4 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster4, method='bilinear')

myRaster4
plot(myRaster4, main="Raster with 1 pixels")


#let's create a layout with 4 rasters in it
#notice that each raster has the SAME extent but is of different resolution
#because it has a different number of pixels spread out over the same extent.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(myRaster2, main="Raster with 32 pixels")
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")
plot(myRaster3, main="Raster with 4 pixels")
plot(myRaster4, main="Raster with 2 pixels")

```

##Coordinate Reference System / Projection Information

> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

The earth is round. This is not an new concept by any means, however we need to 
remember this when we talk about coordinate reference systems associated with 
spatial data. When we make maps on paper or on a computer screen, we are moving 
from a 3 dimensional space (the globe) to 2 dimensions (our computer screens or 
a piece of paper). To keep this short, the projection of a dataset relates to 
how the data are "flattened" in geographic space so our human eyes and brains 
can make sense of the information in 2 dimensions. 

The projection refers to the mathematical calculations performed to "flatten the 
data" in into 2D space. The coordinate system references to the x and y coordinate 
space that is associated with the projection used to flatten the data. If you 
have the same dataset saved in two different projections, these two files won't 
line up correctly when rendered together.

##What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and 
projections in greater detail. However, for the purposes of this activity, what 
is important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in 
different projections **will not line up in any GIS or other program**. Thus 
it's important when working with spatial data in a program like `R` or `Python` 
to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data, and to grab 
that information and retain it when you process / analyze the data.

For a library of CRS information: 
<a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">A great online 
library of CRS information.</a>



## CRS Strings

```{r view-CRS-strings }

library('rgdal')
epsg = make_EPSG()
#View(epsg)
head(epsg)

```


### Define the extent

In the above example, we created a raster object in R. R defaulted to a global
lat/long extent. We can define the exact extent that we need to use too. Let's
modify the extent. 

In this example, we know that our data are in UTM zone 11N just like our DEM that
we imported above was. We also know that the left hand corner coordinate of the raster
is:  

* xmin = 254570
* ymin = 4107302

The resolution of this dataset is `1 meter` and we will be working
in UTM (meters). Let's define the rasters extent.

```{r define-extent}

#create a raster from the matrix
newMatrix  <- (matrix(1:8, nrow = 10, ncol = 20))

#create a raster from the matrix
rasterNoProj <- raster(newMatrix)
rasterNoProj
#Define the xmin and y min (the lower left hand corner of the raster)
xMin = 254570
yMin = 4107302

# we can grab the cols and rows for the raster using @ncols and @nrows
rasterNoProj@ncols
rasterNoProj@nrows

# define the resolution
res=1.0

# If we add the numbers of cols and rows to the x,y corner location, we get the
#bounds of our raster extent. 
xMax <- xMin + (myRaster1@ncols * res)
yMax <- yMin + (myRaster1@nrows * res)

#create a raster extent class
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
rasExt

#finally apply the extent to our raster
rasterNoProj@extent <- rasExt
rasterNoProj
#view extent only
rasterNoProj@extent
#Now we have an extent associated with our raster which places it in space!
rasterNoProj
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(rasterNoProj, main="Raster in UTM coordinates, 1 m resolution")

```

###Challenges
* Resample `rasterNoProj` from 1 meter to 10 meter resolution. Plot it next to the 1 m 
resolution raster. Use: `par(mfrow=c(1,2))` to create side by side plots.
* What happens to the extent if you change the resolution to 1.5 when calculating 
the raster's extent properties??

## Define projection of a raster

We can define the projection of a raster that has a KNOWN CRS already. Sometimes
we download data that have projection information associated with them BUT the CRS
is not defined either in the Geotiff tags or in the raster itself. If this is the 
case, we can simply assign the raster the correct projection. 

Be CAREFUL doing this - it is not the same thing as REPROJECTING your data.

```{r define-raster-projection }

#let's define the projection for our data using the DEM raster that already has 
#defined CRS.
#NOTE: in this case we have to KNOW that our raster is in this projection already!
rasterNoProj@crs
#view the crs of our DEM object.
DEM@crs

#define the CRS using a CRS of another raster
rasterNoProj@crs  <- DEM@crs
#look at the attributes
rasterNoProj
#view just the crs
rasterNoProj@crs

```

IMPORTANT: the above code does NOT REPROJECT the raster. It simply defines the
Coordinate Reference System based upon the CRS of another raster. If you want to
actually CHANGE the CRS of a raster, you need to use the `projectRaster` function.

##Challenge
1. You can set the CRS and extent of a raster using the syntax 
`rasterWithoutReference@crs <- rasterWithReference@crs` and 
`rasterWithoutReference@extent <- rasterWithReference@extent`. Open `band90.tif` in the 
`rasterLayers_tif` folder of your working directory. You might want to look at it in 
<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> first compared to the other rasters. 
Does it line up? Look closely at the extent and pixel size. Does anything look off? 
Fix what's missing. Export a new geotiff. Do things line up in 
<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS?</a>
2. The code below creates a raster and seeds it with some data. Experiment with the code. 
What happens to the resulting raster's resolution when you change the range of lat and 
long values to 5 instead of 10? Try 20, 50 and 100? What is the relationship between the 
extent and the raster resolution?

**Code Sample:**

    latLong <- data.frame(longitude=seq( 0,10,1), latitude=seq( 0,10,1))
    #make spatial points dataframe, which will have a spatial extent
    sp <- SpatialPoints( latLong[ c("longitude" , "latitude") ], proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") )
	
    #make raster based on the extent of your data
    r <- raster(nrow=5, ncol=5, extent( sp ) )
    r[]  <- 1
    r[]  <- sample(0:50,25)
    r


##Reprojecting Data
If you run into multiple spatial datasets with varying projections, you can 
always **reproject** the data so that they are all in the same projection. Python 
and R both have reprojection tools that perform this task.


```{r reproject-data }

# reproject raster data from UTM to CRS of Lat/Long WGS84

reprojectedData1 <- projectRaster(rasterNoProj, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ")

#note that the extent has been adjusted to account for the NEW crs
reprojectedData1@crs
reprojectedData1@extent
#note the range of values in the output data
reprojectedData1

# use nearest neighbor interpolation  method to ensure that the values stay the same
reprojectedData2 <- projectRaster(rasterNoProj, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ", 
                                 method = "ngb")

#http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/raster/docs/projectRaster
#note that the min and max values have now been forced to stay within the same range.
reprojectedData2

```
