</div>

###Getting Started
This activity will overview the key attributes of a raster object, that you need to 
to work with it in tools like `R`, `Python` and `QGIS` including:

1. Spatial Resolution
2. Coordinate Reference System / Projection Information
3. Raster Extent

In order to correctly spatially refence a raster that is not already georeferenced,
you will additional need:

1. The lower left hand corner of the raster.
2. The number of columns and rows that the raster dataset contains.

This post will overview the key components of hyperspectral remote sensing data 
that are required to begin working with the data in a tool like `R` or `Python`.
 
##Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions 
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel 
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the 
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. 
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in 
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell 
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel 
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>


```{r View-raster-attributes }

#load raster library
library(raster)

# Load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
DEM <- raster("DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  

# View raster attributes 
# Note that this raster (in geotiff format) already has an extent, resolution, 
# CRS defined
DEM

```


##Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a raster, represents the "X, Y" coordinates of the corners 
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell 
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel 
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like `R`, using supporting packages such as `rgdal` 
and associated raster tools often have comments that allow you to define the 
extent of a raster that is created within the tool. 

```{r set-raster-extent }

# View the extent of the raster
DEM@extent

# Set raster extent (R Code)
# xMN = minimum x value, xMX=maximum x value, yMN - minimum Y value, yMX=maximum Y value
#rasExt <- extent(xMN,xMX,yMN,yMX)

```

###Calculating Raster Extent
Extent and spatial resolution are closely connected. To calculate the extent of a 
raster, we first need the bottom LEFT HAND (X,Y) coordinate of the raster. In 
the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in meters, to calculate
the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and rows to the X,Y corner 
location of the raster, multiplied by the resolution (the pixel size) of the raster.

Let's explore that next.

```{r calculate-extent }

newMatrix  <- (matrix(1:8, nrow = 10, ncol = 20))

#create a raster from the matrix
myRaster <- raster(newMatrix)

#view attributes of the raster
myRaster

#is the CRS defined?
myRaster@crs

#what are the data extents?
myRaster@extent

plot(myRaster)

```

### Define the extent

In this case, we have defined a raster. However, the extent defaults to 0-1. Let's
modify the extent. We'll use the x,y values:

* xmin = 254570
* ymin = 4107302

to define the extent. The resolution of this dataset is `1 meter` and we will be working
in UTM (meters).

```{r define-extent}

#Define the xmin and y min (the lower left hand corner of the raster)
xMin = 254570
yMin = 4107302

# we can grab the cols and rows for the raster using @ncols and @nrows
myRaster@ncols
myRaster@nrows

# define the resolution
res=1.0

# If we add the numbers of cols and rows to the x,y corner location, we get the
#bounds of our raster extent. 
xMax <- xMin + (myRaster@ncols * res)
yMax <- yMin + (myRaster@nrows * res)

#create a raster extent class
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
rasExt

#finally apply the extent to our raster
myRaster@extent <- rasExt

#Now we have an extent associated with our raster which places it in space!
myRaster

plot(myRaster)

```

###Challenge
* What happens to the extent if you change the resolution to 1.5 when calculating 
the raster's properties?? How does the extent change?

##Coordinate Reference System / Projection Information

> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

The earth is round. This is not an new concept by any means, however we need to 
remember this when we talk about coordinate reference systems associated with 
spatial data. When we make maps on paper or on a computer screen, we are moving 
from a 3 dimensional space (the globe) to 2 dimensions (our computer screens or 
a piece of paper). To keep this short, the projection of a dataset relates to 
how the data are "flattened" in geographic space so our human eyes and brains 
can make sense of the information in 2 dimensions. 

The projection refers to the mathematical calculations performed to "flatten the 
data" in into 2D space. The coordinate system references to the x and y coordinate 
space that is associated with the projection used to flatten the data. If you 
have the same dataset saved in two different projections, these two files won't 
line up correctly when rendered together.

##What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and 
projections in greater detail. However, for the purposes of this activity, what 
is important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in 
different projections **will not line up in any GIS or other program**. Thus 
it's important when working with spatial data in a program like `R` or `Python` 
to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data, and to grab 
that information and retain it when you process / analyze the data.

#http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/

```{r define-raster-projection }

#let's define the projection for our data using the DEM raster that already has 
#defined CRS.

#view the crs of our DEM object.
DEM@crs

#define the CRS using a CRS of another raster
myRaster@crs  <- DEM@crs
#look at the attributes
myRaster

```

## CRS Strings

```{r view-CRS-strings }

library('rgdal')
epsg = make_EPSG()
#View(epsg)
head(epsg)

```


##Reprojecting Data
If you run into multiple spatial datasets with varying projections, you can 
always **reproject** the data so that they are all in the same projection. Python 
and R both have reprojection tools that perform this task.


```{r reproject-data }


# reproject raster data to CRS of dataset2 in R

# use nearest neighbor to ensure that the values stay the same
reprojectedData1 <- projectRaster(myRaster, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ")
#note the range of values in the output data
reprojectedData1

# use nearest neighbor interpolation  method to ensure that the values stay the same
reprojectedData2 <- projectRaster(myRaster, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ", 
                                 method = "ngb")
