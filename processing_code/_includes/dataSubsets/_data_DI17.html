To complete this tutorial, you will need data available from the NEON 2017 Data
Institute teaching data set available for download. 

Caution: This data set includes all the data for the 2017 Data Institute, 
including hyperspectral and lidar data sets and is therefore a large file (12 GB). 
Ensure that you have sufficient space on your 
hard drive before you begin the download. If not, download to an external 
hard drive and make sure to correct for the change in file path when working 
through the tutorial.ÃŸ
