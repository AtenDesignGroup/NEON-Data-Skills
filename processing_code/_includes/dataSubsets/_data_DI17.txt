<h3> <a href="https://neondata.sharefile.com/d-s11d5c8b9c53426db"> NEON Teaching Data Subset: Data Institute 2017 Data Set</a></h3> 

To complete this tutorial, you will use data available from the NEON 2017 Data
Institute teaching dataset available for download. 

Caution: This dataset includes all the data for the 2017 Data Institute, 
including hyperspectral and lidar datasets and is therefore a large file (12 GB). 
Ensure that you have sufficient space on your 
hard drive before you begin the download. If not, download to an external 
hard drive and make sure to correct for the change in file path when working 
through the tutorial.

The LiDAR and imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset 
were collected over the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/" target="_blank" >field sites</a>
and processed at NEON headquarters.
The entire dataset can be accessed on the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> NEON data portal</a>.
