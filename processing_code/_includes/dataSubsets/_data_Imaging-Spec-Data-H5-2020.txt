Download NEON Teaching Data Subset: Imaging Spectrometer Data - HDF5 </a></h3>

These hyperspectral remote sensing data provide information on the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank" > San Joaquin 
Exerimental Range field site</a> in March of 2019.
The data were collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California 
(Domain 17) and processed at NEON headquarters. This data subset is derived from 
the mosaic tile named NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5. 
The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> NEON Data Portal</a>.

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).
