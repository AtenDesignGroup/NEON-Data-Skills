  name: Understanding Ecological Disturbance Events with Data Teaching Module
  description: "This lesson demonstrates ways that scientists identify and use 
data that they use to study disturbance events. Further, it encourages students 
to think about why we need to quantify change and different types of data 
needed to quantify the change. This lesson focuses on flooding as a natural 
disturbance event with impacts on the local human populations. Specifically, it 
focuses on the causes and impacts of flooding that occurred in 2013 throughout 
Colorado with an emphasis on Boulder County."
