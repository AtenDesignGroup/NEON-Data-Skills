Welcome! This site is devoted to open science and big data. We facilite and support the 
use of big data in science and education! On this site you will find activities that teach
core programming and data literacy skills and knowledge. If you have ideas for other topics, 
please get in touch via any of the links on the left hand side of this page! I look forward to hearing
from you!
