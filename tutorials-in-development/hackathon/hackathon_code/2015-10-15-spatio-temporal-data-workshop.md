#Overview

##Persona

Jessica, is putting together her dissertation proposal as a part of her PHD 
program in ecology at University of Boulder, CO.  She is interested in exploring 
some of her field sites to understand how phenology of vegetation (greening in 
the spring summer and senescence in the winter, varies across multiple sites and 
through time. Her PhD advisor has given her some data for a few sites which have 
very different vegetation communities including Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) 
and San Joachin Experimental Range (California). The data include:

1.Vegetation greenness (NDVI) derived from the Landsat Satellite (30 meter resolution) 
for both sites for 2 years derived from the landsat sensor in a raster format.
2. Some high resolution images of the sites.
3. A canopy height model showing tree height
4. A DEM (digital elevation model) showing topography.
5. Site temperature, PAR (Photosynthetic active radiation), Soil temperature, 
Precipitation and daylength for each day over those two years

Jessica has done some of the things above using her favorite open source GIS tool 
- QGIS. However that workflow makes it difficult to process and look at multiple 
years worth of data. She wants to create an efficient reproducible workflow that 
she can use as she collects data for more sites and years over time to support her 
dissertation work. She has never opened shapefiles and rasters in a non-gui 
environment. She also understands what a raster is but doesnâ€™t know where the ndvi 
data come from.

Jessica would like to create the following outputs to better understand her project:

* Plots of temperature, precipitation, PAR and daylength over the 2 year time period 
(metrics which related to the greening and browning of plants)  compared to NDVI (greenness).
* Basemaps of her site showing 
* The location of the tower that measured the above variables and imagery showing what the site look like.
tree height
* Topography
* A time series animation of NDVI for both sites that she can post on her blog.
 
 
#P1. The Geospatial Landscape

**stuff here**

#P2. Work With Raster and Vector Data In R 

Goal: Participants will know how to  import raster and vector data in R, view metadata / attributes of each in R.

##Learning Objectives:

* Understand the difference between vector and raster data (could be covered in P1)
* Know how to open up a shapefile in R (brief explanation of shapefile)
* Understand point, line and polygons
* Know how to open a raster data file in R (brief explanation of geotiff)
* Know how to create a basic map of a raster with a shapefile overlayed.


Below is some code to look at the data and get this module started.. lots more to
add!

#Download the Data

<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/NEON_Spatio_Temporal_Teaching_Dataset/1580068" class="btn btn-success">
 DOWNLOAD NEON Spatio-Temporal Teaching Dataset</a>
 
 About the data -- more to come here.


    #work with rasters
    library(raster)
    #best for importing shapefiles
    library(rgdal) 
    #plotting
    library(ggplot2)
    
    options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    
    #set the working directory
    setwd("~/Documents/data/1_DataPortal_Workshop/1_WorkshopData")


###First plot the basemap to see where the tower boundary is. 

Note, this will require opening up the geotiff imagery for the site.
Then plotting 

CRS: UTM ZONE 18N FOR HARVARD
CRS: UTM ZONE 11N for SJER


    #import imagery
    chm <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")
    #plot chm (make map?)
    plot(chm, main="NEON Canopy Height Model (Tree Height)\nHarvard Forest")

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/2015-10-15-spatio-temporal-data-workshop/view-basemap-1.png) 

    #customize legend, add units (m), remove x and y labels

###opening a multi-band image is different from opening a single band image
We need to use the stack command for this...

more here..


    ################### IMPORT MULTI BAND RASTER (image) #########################
    #note that when you import a multi band image you have to import it as a stack 
    #rather than a raster... this might be worth pointing out in the lesson.
    #it could be good to start with just a single band raster like a CHM, DEM etc?
    
    baseImage <- stack("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")
    
    #plot the image for the site
    #is there a way to plot RGB and add titles, etc (data viz group??)
    plotRGB(baseImage,r=1,g=2,b=3, 
            main="Harvard Tower Site")

###vector data are different from raster

More here on vectors...

Open a point, line and polygon layer here.
NOTE: need to add line and point!

ogr is better than maptools (IMO) :) ... why 


    #Import the shapefile 
    #note: read ogr is preferred as it maintains prj info
    squarePlot <- readOGR("boundaryFiles/HARV/","HarClip_UTMZ18")

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "boundaryFiles/HARV/", layer: "HarClip_UTMZ18"

    #look at the polygon on top of the imagery
    plotRGB(baseImage)
    
    #add the plot boundary to the image. Make it a transparent box with a thick outline
    #Note: leah needs to fix the crop box to make it UTM z18 friendly! it will happen.
    plot(squarePlot, col="yellow", add=TRUE)
    
    #open a line shapefile

###Crop the Base Image to the AOI

This is the area used to clip the NDVI data from. We can expand it a bit.
Concerned with size but i think a bit larger could be ok.


    #crop the image to the plot boundary?
    #note that crop just uses the extent - not that actual shape of the polygon.
    new <- crop(baseImage,squarePlot)
    
    plotRGB(new, axes=F,main="RGB image cropped")

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/2015-10-15-spatio-temporal-data-workshop/crop-image-1.png) 

    #not sure how to add a title to plotRGB??
    
    #export geotiff
    #write the geotiff - change overwrite=TRUE to overwrite=FALSE if you want to 
    #make sure you don't overwrite your files!
    writeRaster(new,"new","GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)


#P2b. Working with Raster Time Series Data

Goal: Participants will know how to work with, extract values from  and plot a set of rasters in R.

###Learning Objectives:

* Know how to open a set of rasters in R as a raster stack
* Know how to plot a raster stack.
* Know how to extract values from a raster
* Know how to extract multiple values from a raster and plot it using GGPLOT.

Import the NDVI time series. 

##NOTE: we could crop these to a larger boundary. right now they are about 1.5mb 
##a tile...


    #define the path to write tiffs
    #the other time series for the california sites is in NDVI/D17
    #Note: if it's best we can also remove the nesting of folders here. I left it
    #just to remember where i got the data from originally! i can just include a note to myself.
    ndvi.tifPath <- "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/"
    
    #open up the cropped files
    #create list of files to make raster stack
    allCropped <-  list.files(ndvi.tifPath, full.names=TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")
    
    #create a raster stack from the list
    rastStack <- stack(allCropped)
    
    #layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
    #would like to figure out how to plot these with 2-3 in each row rather than 4
    plot(rastStack, zlim=c(1500,10000),nc=3)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/2015-10-15-spatio-temporal-data-workshop/process-NDVI-images-HARV-1.png) 

    #VIZ people can show us how to customize the title on the plots
    #Viz people can show us how to adjust the LAYOUT so the figures
    #are easier to read...
    
    #adjust the layout
    #par(mfrow=c(7,2))
    #not sure how to plot fewer columns without throwing errors
    
    #plot histograms for each image
    hist(rastStack,xlim=c(1500,10000))

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/2015-10-15-spatio-temporal-data-workshop/process-NDVI-images-HARV-2.png) 

###Data Cleaning
It looks like something is weird with the data... let's have a closer look at the
original images


    #open up the cropped files
    #create list of files to make raster stack
    rgb.allCropped <-  list.files("Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/", full.names=TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")
    
    #create a layout
    par(mfrow=c(4,4))
    
    #plot all images
    #would be nice to label each one but not sure how with plotRGB
    for (aFile in rgb.allCropped){
      ndvi.rastStack <- stack(aFile)
      plotRGB(ndvi.rastStack, stretch="lin")
    }
    
    #reset layout
    par(mfrow=c(1,1))

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/2015-10-15-spatio-temporal-data-workshop/plot-rgb-images-1.png) 

### Next calculate NDVI

More here...


    #create data frame, calculate NDVI
    ndvi.df.HARV <- as.data.frame(matrix(-999, ncol = 2, nrow = length(allCropped)))
    colnames(ndvi.df.HARV) <- c("julianDays", "meanNDVI")
    i <- 0
    for (crop in allCropped){
      i=i+1
      #open raster
      imageCrop <- raster(crop)
      
      #calculate the mean of each
      ndvi.df.HARV$meanNDVI[i] <- cellStats(imageCrop,mean) 
      
      #grab julian days
      ndvi.df.HARV$julianDays[i] <- substr(crop,nchar(crop)-21,nchar(crop)-19)
    }
    
    #add and populate a year column to the data frame
    ndvi.df.HARV$yr <- as.integer(2009)
    #add and populate a site column to the data frame
    ndvi.df.HARV$site <- "HARV"

###PLOT NDVI for 2011

NOTE: will add tiles for 2009-2010 - have 30 years but that is a lot!
###should we expand the extent or not?

Now, let's plot NDVI for one year

NOTE: there are some bad points in the data. this is because of extreme cloud cover in the imagery. I will try to make a few images we can look at to see that these scenes are bad. It might be good for
the remote sensing group to cover this.

###NOTE - there is a DC lesson on GGPLOT that we might be able to 
###adapt to this!


    ##plot stuff
    #need to figure out the best plotting method to connect the dots! Or a better input format object
    #we also should remove bad points in this layer and explain why the points are bad 
    #cloud cover)
    ggplot(ndvi.df.HARV, aes(julianDays, meanNDVI)) +
      geom_point(size=4,colour = "blue") +

###Below is the same analysis for another site for the same time period!
THe data are for california field site san Joachin experimental range.
This might be an option additional activity to compare the two! Note
that hte NDVI values are generally lower as it's a scrubby medit environment.
We can include photographs of the sites as well!
The data are very interesting!


    #define the path to write tiffs
    tifPath <- "Landsat_NDVI/SJER/2011/ndvi/"
    
    #open up the cropped files
    #create list of files to make raster stack
    allCropped <-  list.files(tifPath, full.names=TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")
    
    #create a raster stack from the list
    rastStack <- stack(allCropped)
    
    #layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
    #would like to figure out how to plot these with 2-3 in each row rather than 4
    plot(rastStack, zlim=c(1500,10000),nc=3)

##Animated Gifs of Time Series in R!

Below is simple code to create an animation from a rasterstack.


    #create animation ot the NDVI outputs
    library(animation)
    
    #if(!file.exists("ndvi.gif")) { # Check if the file exists
      saveGIF(
        for (i in 1:length(allCropped)) {

#P3. Project Organization & Metadata

**Goal:** Participants will understand how to organize a project with geospatial data and what metadata are most important to look at.

##Learning Objectives:

* Know how to look up and grab key attributes of a shapefile in R (extent, CRS)
* Know how to look up and grab key attributes of a raster in R (extent, CRS)
* Understand CRS (coordinate reference systems)
* Know how to reproject files when they donâ€™t line up
* Understand the files associated with a shapefile.



    #might have stuff about storing data
    #stuff on the files associated with a shapefile
    
    #in this case, our data are organized by
    #metric or type of data and then location then year. 
    #thinking about organizing data is important.
    
    #crs and metadata in the geospatial world is also important...

#P4. Working with CSV format Time Series Data

**Goal:** Participants will know how to open, clean and plot quantitative time series data within  a text file.

##Learning Objectives:

* Participants will know how to open a csv file in R
* How to convert a time field to a time class
* How to convert from date to Julian days.
* Remove NA values from a dataset (clean the data)
* Create a plot using GGPLOT
* Plot multiple variables on one plot

Below are the time series data.


    #load ggplot2 for plotting 
    library(ggplot2)
    #the scales library supports breaks and formatting in ggplot
    library(scales)
    
    #don't load strings as factors
    options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

##Dealing with Date AND time
SUGGESTION - we should subset this out for just a few years to begin with. I'd recommend 2009-2011
Otherwise it is too big to work with.

    #harMet$datetime <- fixDate(harMet$datetime,"America/New_York")
    
    # Replace T and Z with a space
    harMet$datetime <- gsub("T|Z", " ", harMet$datetime)
      
    #set the field to be a date field
    harMet$datetime <- as.POSIXct(harMet$datetime,format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M",

##Dealing with just date.

the POSIX format is good to go over...One option could be to do the averaging to 
daily on the data above. But you might need to smooth it so it could get complicated?

But calculating a daily average could be very useful! Just in case - we can include the daily average with the data if people get hung up or we need to skip over that part. I think we should do it.



    #read in daily data
    harMetDaily <- read.csv(file="AtmosData/HARV/hf001-06-daily-m.csv")
    
      
    #set the field to be a date field
    harMetDaily$date <- as.Date(harMetDaily$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
    
    #subset out some of the data - 2010-2013 
    yr.09.11_monAvg <- subset(harMetDaily, date >= as.Date('2009-01-01') & date <=
    as.Date('2011-01-01'))
    
    #as.Date("2006-02-01 00:00:00")
    #plot Some Air Temperature Data
      
    myPlot <- ggplot(yr.09.11_monAvg,aes(date, airt)) +
               geom_point() +
               ggtitle("Daily Air Temperature\nHarvard Forest") +
               theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold",size = 20)) +
               theme(text = element_text(size=20)) +
               xlab("Time") + ylab("Mean Air Temperature")
    
    #format x axis with dates
    myPlot + scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m/%d/%y"))

##Look at Day Length Data for Harvard

NOTE - i need to get the data from 2009-2011 to align with the Landsat Time Series


    #load the lubridate package to work with time
    library(lubridate)
    #readr is ideal to open fixed width files (faster than utils)
    library(readr)
    
    #read in fixed width file  
    dayLengthHar2011 <- read.fwf(
      file="daylength/HARV/Petersham_Mass_2011.txt",
      widths=c(8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9))
     
    names(dayLengthHar2011) <- c("Day","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr",
                                 "May","June","July","Aug","Sept",

###Convert to Julian Days and Plot

Next, plot full year's worth of daylength for 2011.
Note: this could be turned into a function to do multiple files.


    #convert to julian days
    
    #stack the data frame
    dayLengthHar2011.st <- stack(dayLengthHar2011[2:13])
    #remove NA values
    dayLengthHar2011.st <- dayLengthHar2011.st[complete.cases(dayLengthHar2011.st),]
    #add julian days (count)
    dayLengthHar2011.st$JulianDay<-seq.int(nrow(dayLengthHar2011.st))
    #fix names
    names(dayLengthHar2011.st) <- c("Hours","Month","JulianDay")
    
    #plot Years Worth of  data
    ggplot(dayLengthHar2011.st, aes(JulianDay,Hours)) +
      geom_point()+
      ggtitle("Day Length\nJan 2011") +
      xlab("Julian Days") + ylab("Day Length (Hours)") +

#P5. Data Viz  

Goal: Participants will know how create and customize maps of spatial data. Participants will know how to create multi-variable plots of spatial data.

Learning Objectives:

* Know how to create and customize a map in R
* Know how to plot multiple variables on a plot in R

Tasks:
Create a classified map from a raster (tree height?) - (basic classification, mapping)
Customizing a map
Dealing with CRS issues (things donâ€™t line up)
Converting to online (leaflet?)
Plot.ly for time series??
creating layouts with multiple plots

BE creative - have a look at the data. it might be cool for this group to put together 
the NDVI time series and other variables. Then make some cool maps and do something
online (leaflet, plot.ly)


    #Here are things to work on
    
    # Creating a Map in r with a legend and multiple elements
    # import the RGB base image, the shapefile, color the shapefile by atttibute
    # add teh point, customize symbology, colors, labels, title, etc, add a north arrow
    # SO imagine a GIS work flow but do that in R.
    
    # Create a leaflet map showing something?? (optional but could be cool. would require
    #converting to geojson potentially)
    
    #customizing Ggplots and adding multiple variables that are different 
    #IE the dataframes can't be stacked.




#P7. An automated workflow 

What if we wanted to turn the workflow above into a series of loops and functions that handled the data for multiple sites. What if we added an additional year's worth of dat
to each site?

processing the above for multiple sites -- automating spatial analysis workflow in R


    #end of section


#Remote Sensing Workshop 

This group will build on items on the portal
They will consider the arc of skillsets needed to work with HSI imagery and lidar
starting from beginner to advanced. the materials below might fall somewhere in the middle
with some beginner stuff?
