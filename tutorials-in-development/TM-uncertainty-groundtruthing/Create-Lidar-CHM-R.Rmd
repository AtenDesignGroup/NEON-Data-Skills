A common analysis using LiDAR data is to derive top of the canopy height values 
from the LiDAR data. These values are often used to track changes in forest 
structure over time, to calculate biomass, and even leaf area index (LAI). Let's 
dive into the basics of working with raster formatted LiDAR data in R!

## Create a LiDAR derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will provide LiDAR-derived 
data products as one of its many free ecological data products. These products 
will come in the 
[GeoTIFF](http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/ "geotiff (read more)") 
format, which is a .tif raster format that is spatially located on the earth. 

In this tutorial, we create a Canopy Height Model. The 
[canopy height model (CHM)]({{ site.baseurl }}/remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/),
represents the heights of the trees on the ground. We can derive the CHM 
by subtracting the ground elevation from the elevation of the top of the surface 
(or the tops of the trees). 

We will use the `raster` R package to work with the the lidar derived digital 
surface model (DSM) and the digital terrain model (DTM). 

```{r set-up}

# Load needed packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to data folder
#setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

First, we will import the Digital Surface Model (DSM). The 
[DSM]({{ base.url }}/remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/)
represents the elevation of the top of the objects on the ground (trees, 
buildings, etc).

``` {r import-dsm}

# assign raster to object
dsm <- raster("SJER/DigitalSurfaceModel/SJER2013_DSM.tif")

# view info about the raster.
dsm

# plot the DSM
plot(dsm, main="LiDAR Digital Surface Model \n SJER, California")

```

Note the resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system (CRS) of the raster. 
To do later steps, our DTM will need to be the same. 

Next, we will import the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for the same area. The 
[DTM]({{ base.url }} /remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/)
represents the ground (terrain) elevation.

```{r plot-DTM }

# import the digital terrain model
dtm <- raster("SJER/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")

plot(dtm, main="LiDAR Digital Terrain Model \n SJER, California")

```

With both of these rasters now loaded, we can create the Canopy Height Model 
(CHM). The 
[CHM ]({{ base.url }} /remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/)
represents the difference between the DSM and the DTM or the height of all objects
on the surface of the earth. 

To do this we perform some basic raster math to calculate the CHM. You can 
perform the same raster math in a GIS program like 
[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ "QGIS").

When you do the math, make sure to subtract the DTM from the DSM or you'll get 
trees with negative heights!

```{r calculate-plot-CHM }

# use raster math to create CHM
chm <- dsm - dtm

# view CHM attributes
chm

plot(chm, main="LiDAR Canopy Height Model \n SJER, California")

```

We've now created a CHM from our DSM and DTM. What do you notice about the 
canopy cover at this location in the San Joaquin Experimental Range? 

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Basic Raster Math 

Convert the CHM from meters to feet. Plot it. 
</div>

``` {r challenge-code-raster-math, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
# conversion 1m = 3.28084 ft
chm_ft <- chm*3.28084

# plot 
plot(chm_ft, main="LiDAR Canopy Height Model \n in feet")

```

If, in your work you need to create lots of CHMs from different rasters, an 
efficient way to do this would be to create a function to create your CHMs. 

``` {r canopy-function}
# Create a function that subtracts one raster from another
# 
canopyCalc <- function(DTM, DSM) {
  return(DSM -DTM)
  }
    
# use the function to create the final CHM
chm2 <- canopyCalc(dsm,dtm)
chm2

# or use the overlay function
chm3 <- overlay(dsm,dtm,fun = canopyCalc) 
chm3 

```

As with any raster, we can write out the CHM as a GeoTiff using the 
`writeRaster()` function. 

```{r write-raster-to-geotiff, eval=FALSE }
# write out the CHM in tiff format. 
writeRaster(chm,"chm_SJER.tiff","GTiff")

```

We've now successfully created a canopy height model using basic raster math -- in 
R! We can bring the `chm_SJER.tiff` file into QGIS (or any GIS program) and look 
at it. 

Consider

## Part 2. Groundtruth the CHM

We now have a canopy height model (CHM) for our study area in California. 
However, how do the height values extracted from the CHM compare to our 
laboriously collected, field measured canopy height data? To figure this out, we 
will use manually collected tree height data, measured within circular plots 
across our study area. We will compare the maximum measured tree height value to 
the maximum LiDAR derived height value for each circular plot using regression.

For this analysis, we need two .csv (comma separate value) files. One, 
`SJER/VegetationData/D17_2013_vegStr.csv`, contains our vegetation structure data 
for each plot. The other, `SJER/PlotCentroids/SJERPlotCentroids.csv`, contains the
plot centroid location information (X,Y) where we measured trees. Let's start by 
plotting the plot locations where we measured trees (in red) on a map. 

We will need to convert the plot centroids to a spatial points dataset in R. This
is why we loaded the two additional packages at the beginning - the spatial package 
[sp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html "R sp package") - 
and a data manipulation package 
[dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html "dplyr").

NOTE: the `sp` library typically installs when you install the raster package. 

Let's get started with the plotting!

```{r read-veg }

# import the centroid data and the vegetation structure data
# this means all strings of letter coming in will remain character
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# read in plot centroids
centroids <- read.csv("SJER/PlotCentroids/SJERPlotCentroids.csv")
str(centroids)

# read in vegetation heights
vegStr <- read.csv("SJER/VegetationData/D17_2013_vegStr.csv")
str(vegStr)
```

Since both files have eastings and northings we can use this data to plot onto 
our existing raster. 

``` {r plot-veg}

## overlay the centroid points and the stem locations on the CHM plot
# plot the chm
myCol=terrain.colors(6)
plot(chm,col=myCol, main="Plot & Tree Locations", breaks=c(-2,0,2,10,40))

## plotting details: cex = point size, pch 0 = square
# plot square around the centroid
points(centroids$easting,centroids$northing, pch=0, cex = 2 )
# plot location of each tree measured
points(vegStr$easting,vegStr$northing, pch=19, cex=.5, col = 2)

```

Now we have a plot of our CHM showing trees of different (categorical) heights. 
Why might we have chosen these breaks? 

On this CHM plot we've marked the locations of the plot centers. Note the black 
box isn't the plot boundary, but determined by the plot marker we chose so that 
we can see the centroids that would otherwise be "under" the tree height points.
We've also plotted the locations of individual trees we measured (red overlapping 
circles). 

Plotting Tips: use `help(points)` to read about the options for plotting points.
Or to see a list of `pch` values (symbols), check out 
<a href="http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/pchsymbols.php" target="_blank">this website.</a>

## Spatial Data Need a Coordinate Reference System

We plotted the easting and northing of the points accurately on the map, but 
our data doesn't yet 
have a specific Coordinate Reference System attached to it. The CRS is 
information that allows a program like QGIS to determine where the data are 
located, in the world. 
<a href="http://www.sco.wisc.edu/coordinate-reference-systems/coordinate-reference-systems.html" target="_blank">
Read more about CRS here</a>

We need to assign a Coordinate Reference System to our insitu data. In this case, 
we know these data are all in the same projection as our original CHM. We can 
quickly figure out what projection an object is in, using `object@crs`.

```{r check-CRS}
# check CHM CRS
chm@crs

```

So our data is in UTM Zone 11 which is correct for California. We can use this 
CRS to make our data points into a Spatial Points Data Frame which then allows 
the points to be treated as spatial objects. 

``` {r createSpatialDf}
## create SPDF: SpatialPointsDataFrame()
# specify the northing (columns 4) & easting (column 3) in order
# specify CRS proj4string: borrow CRS from chm 
# specify raster
centroid_spdf = SpatialPointsDataFrame(centroids[,4:3], 
																			 proj4string=chm@crs, 
																			 centroids)

# check centroid CRS
# note SPDFs don't have a crs slot so `object@crs` won't work
centroid_spdf

```

We now have our centoid data as a spatial points data frame. This will allow us
to work with them as spatial data along with other spatial data -- like rasters. 

### Extract CMH Data from Buffer Area

In order to accomplish a goal of comparing the CHM with our ground data, we 
want to extract the CHM height at the point for each tree we measured. To do this,
we will create a boundary region (called a buffer) representing the spatial
extent of each plot (where trees were measured). We will then extract all CHM pixels
that fall within the plot boundary to use to estimate tree height for that plot.

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/BufferCircular.png">
    <figcaption>When a circular buffer is applied to a raster, some pixels fall 
    fully within the buffer but some are partially excluded. Values for all 
    pixels in the specified raster that fall within the circular buffer are 
    extracted.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

There are a few ways to go about this task. As our plots are circular, we'll use
the extract function in R allows you 
to specify a circular buffer with a given radius around an x,y point location. 
Values for all pixels in the specified raster that fall within the circular 
buffer are extracted. In this case, we can tell R to extract the maximum value 
of all pixels using the `fun=max` command.

Note: Have square plots? Check out our
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-with-field-data/Field-Data-Polygons-From-Centroids" target="_blank"> *Create A Square Buffer Around a Plot Centroid in R* tutorial</a>.


### Variation 1: Extract Plot Data Using Circle: 20m Radius Plots

```{r extract-plot-data }

# Insitu sampling took place within 40m x 40m square plots so we use a 20m radius.	
# Note that below will return a dataframe containing the max height
# calculated from all pixels in the buffer for each plot
cent_ovr <- extract(chm,centroid_spdf,buffer = 20, fun=max, df=TRUE)

#grab the names of the plots from the centroid_spdf
cent_ovr$plot_id <- centroid_spdf$Plot_ID  
#fix the column names
names(cent_ovr) <- c('ID','chmMaxHeight','plot_id')

#merge the chm data into the centroids data.frame
centroids <- merge(centroids, cent_ovr, by.x = 'Plot_ID', by.y = 'plot_id')

#have a look at the centroids dataFrame
head(centroids)


```

#### If you want to explore The Data Distribution

If you want to explore the data distribution of pixel height values in each plot, 
you could remove the `fun` call to max and generate a list. 
`cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)`. It's good to look at the 
distribution of values we've extracted for each plot. Then you could generate a 
histogram for each plot `hist(cent_ovrList[[2]])`. If we wanted, we could loop 
through several plots and create histograms using a `for loop`.

```{r explore-data-distribution, eval=FALSE }

#cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)
# create histograms for the first 5 plots of data
#for (i in 1:5) {
#  hist(cent_ovrList[[i]], main=(paste("plot",i)))
#  }

```

# Challenge

> One way to setup a layout with multiple plots in R is: `par(mfrow=c(6,3)) `. 
> This code will give you 6 rows of plots with 3 plots in each row. Modify the 
> `for loop` above to plot all 18 histograms. Improve upon the plot's final 
> appearance to make a readable final figure. 

###Variation 2: Extract CHM values Using a Shapefile

If your plot boundaries are saved in a shapefile, you can use the code below. 
There are two shapefiles in the folder named "PlotCentroid_Shapefile" within the 
zip file that you downloaded at the top of this page. NOTE: to import a shapefile 
using the code below, you'll need to have the `maptools` package installed which 
requires the `rgeos` package. Be sure to install them first:

```{r extract-w-shapefile }

#install needed packages
#install.packages(rgeos)
#install.packages(maptools)

#call the maptools package
#library(maptools)
#extract CHM data using polygon boundaries from a shapefile
#squarePlot <- readShapePoly("PlotCentroid_Shapefile/SJERPlotCentroids_Buffer.shp")
#centroids$chmMaxShape <- extract(chm, squarePlot, weights=FALSE, fun=max)

```

###Variation 3: Derive Square Plot boundaries, then CHM values around a point

 [extracting square shapes activity.]({{ site.baseurl }}/working-with-field-data/Field-Data-Polygons-From-Centroids/ "Polygons")

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/BufferSquare.png">
    <figcaption>If you had square shaped plots, the code in the link above would
    extract pixel values within a square shaped buffer.
    </figcaption>
</figure>



##Extract descriptive stats from Insitu Data 
In our final step, we will extract summary height values from our field data. 
We will use the `dplyr` library to do this efficiently. We'll demonstrate both below

### Extract stats from our data.frame using DPLYR

First let's see how many plots are in the centroid folder.
```{r unique-plots }

# How many plots are there?
unique(insitu_dat$plotid) 

```


Next, find the maximum MEASURED stem height value for each plot. We will compare 
this value to the max CHM value.

```{r analyze-plot-dplyr }

library(dplyr)

#get list of unique plot id's 
unique(insitu_dat$plotid) 

#looks like we have data for two sites
unique(insitu_dat$siteid) 

plotsSJER <- insitu_dat

#we've got some plots for SOAP which is a different region.
#let's just select plots with SJER data
#plotsSJER <- filter(insitu_dat, grepl('SJER', siteid))

#how many unique siteids do we have now?
#unique(plotsSJER$siteid) 


#find the max stem height for each plot
insitu_maxStemHeight <- plotsSJER %>% 
  group_by(plotid) %>% 
  summarise(max = max(stemheight))

head(insitu_maxStemHeight)


names(insitu_maxStemHeight) <- c("plotid","insituMaxHt")
head(insitu_maxStemHeight)
# Optional - do this all in one line of nested commands
#insitu <- insitu_dat %>% filter(plotid %in% centroids$Plot_ID) %>% 
#	      group_by(plotid) %>% 
#	      summarise(max = max(stemheight), quant = quantile(stemheight,.95))
	
```

## Option 2 - Use Base R to achieve the same results

If you don't want to use DPLYR, you can also achieve the same results using base 
R. However, the DPLYR workflow is more similar to a typical database approach.


```{r analyze-base-r }

#Use the aggregate function, the arguments of which are: 
#      the data on which you want to calculate something ~ the grouping variable
#      the FUNction

#insitu_maxStemHeight <- aggregate( insitu_inCentroid$stemheight ~ 
#                                     insitu_inCentroid$plotid, FUN = max )  

#Assign cleaner names to the columns
#names(insitu_maxStemHeight) <- c('plotid','max')

#OPTIONAL - combine the above steps into one line of code.
#add the max and 95th percentile height value for all trees within each plot
#insitu <- cbind(insitu_maxStemHeight,'quant'=tapply(insitu_inCentroid		$stemheight, 
#     insitu_inCentroid$plotid, quantile, prob = 0.95))	

```

### Merge the data into the centroids data.frame

Once we have our summarized insitu data, we can `merge` it into the centroids 
`data.frame`. Merge requires two data.frames and the names of the columns 
containing the unique ID that we will merge the data on. In this case, we will
merge the data on the plot_id column. Notice that it's spelled slightly differently 
in both data.frames so we'll need to tell R what it's called in each data.frame.

```{r merge-dataframe}

#merge the insitu data into the centroids data.frame
centroids <- merge(centroids, insitu_maxStemHeight, by.x = 'Plot_ID', by.y = 'plotid')
head(centroids)

```

### Plot Data (CHM vs Measured)
Let's create a plot that illustrates the relationship between in situ measured 
max canopy height values and LiDAR derived max canopy height values.

We can make a simple plot using the base R `plot` function:

```{r plot-data }

#create basic plot
plot(x = centroids$chmMaxHeight, y=centroids$insituMaxHt)

```

Or we can use ggplot:

```{r plot-w-ggplot}

library(ggplot2)
#create plot
ggplot(centroids,aes(x=chmMaxHeight, y =insituMaxHt )) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Maximum measured height") + 
  xlab("Maximum LiDAR pixel")+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1)+
  xlim(0, max(centroids[,7:8])) + 
  ylim(0,max(centroids[,7:8]))

```


We can also add a regression fit to our plot. Explore the GGPLOT options and 
customize your plot.

```{r ggplot-data }

#plot with regression fit
p <- ggplot(centroids,aes(x=chmMaxHeight, y =insituMaxHt )) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ylab("Maximum Measured Height") + 
  xlab("Maximum LiDAR Height")+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +
  xlim(0, max(centroids[,7:8])) + 
  ylim(0,max(centroids[,7:8])) 

p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "grey")) + 
  ggtitle("LiDAR CHM Derived vs Measured Tree Height") +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=20, vjust=1.9)) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=90, hjust=0.54, vjust=1)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=00, hjust=0.54, vjust=-.2))

```



You have now successfully created a canopy height model using LiDAR data AND compared LiDAR 
derived vegetation height, within plots, to actual measured tree height data!


#Challenge

## Create Plot.ly Interactive Plot

Plot.ly is a free to use, online interactive data viz site. If you have the 
plot.ly library installed, you can quickly export a ggplot graphic into plot.ly!
 (NOTE: it also works for python matplotlib)!! To use plotly, you need to setup 
an account. Once you've setup an account, you can get your key from the plot.ly 
site to make the code below work.


```{r create-plotly, eval=FALSE }

library(plotly)
#setup your plot.ly credentials
set_credentials_file("yourUserName", "yourKey")
p <- plotly(username="yourUserName", key="yourKey")

#generate the plot
py <- plotly()
py$ggplotly()

```
