This project uses hdf5 hyperspectral data from the NEON AOP. The data files are large and so are not stored in this repository, they are meant to be located in a folder sister to this one. There should be 3 hdf files to start.

These example data to use for this exercise are available at doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.6807134

To download all the file, use the following URL:   https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/6807134/versions/1
