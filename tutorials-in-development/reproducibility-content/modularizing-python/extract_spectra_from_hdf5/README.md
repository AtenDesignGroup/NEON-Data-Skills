# Scripts to extract and plot the spectra from hyperspectral imagery hdf5 files

This folder contains scripts and output to extract the spectra from single pixels of hyperspectral data stored in NEON's 2016+ hdf5 format and output csv files and some diagnostic figures.

It the `code` and `data` subdirectories each have READMEs of their own, and explain the files within them in more detail. Also present in this repository is a conda `environment.yml` file, which can be used to install the necessary packages to run these analyses.

This can be accomplished by running the following command:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
