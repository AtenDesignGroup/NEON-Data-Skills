{% include _toc.html %}

Several factors contributed to extreme flooding that occured in Boulder,
Colorado in 2013. In this lesson, we will explore and visualize the data of two 
key variables including:

* Precipitation (rainfall) data collected by ???NDCD?? 
* Stream discharge (or flow) that occured due to combination of the drought 
conditions and extreme rainfall.

## Data: Precipitation & Stream Discharge

The heavy **precipitation (rain)** that occurred in September 2013 drove the 
many of the flood impacts including increased **stream discharge (flow)**. In 
this lesson we will download, explore, and visualize the precipitation & stream 
discharge data collected during this time to better understand this important 
flood driver.

The precipitation data were collected by the National Climatic Data Center 
(NCDC)- another data provider that, like USGS has a network of sensors located 
across the United States collecting climatic data including temperature and 
precipitation.

## Obtaining the Data

The precipitation data that we will use is from the Cooperative Observer Network (COOP)

Through the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program (COOP), more than 10,000 volunteers take daily weather observations at National Parks, seashores, mountaintops, and farms as well as in urban and suburban areas. COOP data usually consist of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals. These data may include additional hydrological or meteorological data such as evaporation or soil temperatures. Online data access is provided at no charge. If you would like to order certified copies, please visit the Certification of Data page.


## R Libraries

We will be working with time-series data in this lesson so we will load the
`lubridate` library. We will use `ggplot2` to efficiently plot our data.

```{r load-libraries}

library(lubridate) # work with time series data
library(ggplot2)  # create efficient, professional plots
library(plotly) # create cool interactive plots

```

#Import Precipitation Data

We will use the `precip-discharge/2013-precip-data-640457.csv` file in this
analysis. These data were downloaded from the NCDC portal... more

After quickly looking at our data, we see that they are separated or delimited
by a comma `,`. We can use `read.csv` to import comma separated data. After we
import the data, let's have a look at the `head` (which defaults to the first 6
lines)of the `data.frame`. Then, let's explore the object structure.

```{r import-precip }

#import precip data into R data.frame
precip.boulder <- read.csv("precip-discharge/2013-precip-data-640457.csv",
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                           header = TRUE)
#view first 6 lines of the data
head(precip.boulder)
#view structure of data
str(precip.boulder)

```

#About the Data Structure
Viewing the structure of these data, we can see that a few potential issues with
the data. The date field is in a character class.

```{r }
#convert date time
precip.boulder$DATE <- as.POSIXct(precip.boulder$DATE,
                                  format="%Y%m%d %H:%M")

#clean up no data values
precip.boulder$HPCP[precip.boulder$HPCP==99999] <- NA

#select just September & October
limits <- as.POSIXct(c("2013-09-01", "2013-10-31"))

#plot the data - September-October
precPlot <- ggplot(data=precip.boulder,
      aes(DATE, HPCP)) +
      geom_bar(stat="identity") +
      scale_x_datetime(limits=limits) +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 300))
      
#add title and labels
precPlot + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
          xlab("Time") + ylab("Precipitation (100th of an inch)") +
          ggtitle("Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n Boulder Creek 2013")

```


```{r daily-summaries }

library(plyr)
#add a day column in the data frame
#NOTE From Megan: Unsure what the flood.data(precip.boulder$DATE, "days") was refering to.  It wasn't functioning. 
precip.boulder$daily <- precip.boulder$DATE

#summarize by day
dailyPrecip.boulder <- ddply(precip.boulder, "daily", summarise, x=sum(HPCP))

names(dailyPrecip.boulder)

#let's create a more meaningful column header for the precip value
names(dailyPrecip.boulder) <- c("day","prec_100In")

# view names
names(dailyPrecip.boulder)

#are there NoDataValues?
sum(is.na(dailyPrecip.boulder))

#remove rows with no data
dailyPrecip.boulder.cln <- na.omit(dailyPrecip.boulder)

#plot the data - September-October
precPlot <- ggplot(data=dailyPrecip.boulder.cln,
      aes(day,prec_100In)) +
       geom_bar(stat="identity") +
      scale_x_datetime(limits = limits) +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 250))
      
#add title and labels
precPlot + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
          xlab("Time") + ylab("Precipitation (100th of an inch)") +
          ggtitle("Daily Precipitation - Boulder Station\n Boulder Creek 2013")


```

## Units
It looks like our precipitation data are in 100th of an inch. Let's convert the 
data to inches - units that we might be a bit more accustomed to. And then let's
plot the data as a bar plot rather than a scatter plot.

```{r convert-units }


#convert to inches
dailyPrecip.boulder.cln$prec_in <- dailyPrecip.boulder.cln$prec_100In / 100

head(dailyPrecip.boulder.cln)

#plot the data - September-October
precPlot_2013 <- ggplot(data=dailyPrecip.boulder.cln,
      aes(day,prec_in)) +
      geom_bar(stat="identity") +
      scale_x_datetime(limits=limits) +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 2.5))
      
#add title and labels
precPlot_2013 <- precPlot_2013 + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
         xlab("2013") + ylab("Precipitation (Inches)") +
         ggtitle("Daily Total Precipitation - Boulder Station\n Boulder Creek 2013")

#plot
precPlot_2013

```

#Interactive Plots - Plot.ly

Let's turn our plot into an interactive plot.ly plot



```{r plotly-precip-data }

library(plotly)
#setup your plot.ly credentials
Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="your.user.name.here")
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="your.key.here")

#subset out some of the data - July-November
dailyPrec.sub <- subset(dailyPrecip.boulder.cln, 
                        day >= as.POSIXct('2013-08-15 00:00',
                        tz = "America/New_York") & day <=
        as.POSIXct('2013-10-15 23:59', tz = "America/Denver"))


#create new plot
new <- ggplot(data=dailyPrec.sub, aes(day,prec_in)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  xlab("Time") + ylab("Precipitation (inches)") +
  ggtitle("Daily Total Precipitation (Inches) - Boulder Creek 2013") 

#view plotly plot in R
ggplotly()

#publish plotly plot to your plot.ly online account when you are happy with it
plotly_POST(new)


```

#About the Data - USGS Stream Discharge Data

The USGS has a distributed network of aquatic sensors located in streams across
the United States. These network monitors a suit of variables that are important
to stream morphology and health. One of the metrics that this sensor network
monitors is **Stream Discharge**, a metric which quantifies the volume of water
moving down a stream. Discharge is an ideal metric to quantify flow, which
increases significantly during a flood event.

> As defined by USGS: Discharge is the volume of water moving down a stream or 
> river per unit of time, 
> commonly expressed in cubic feet per second or gallons per day. In general, 
> river discharge is computed by multiplying the area of water in a channel
> cross 
> section by the average velocity of the water in that cross section.

## Getting USGS Stream Gauge Data

For this lesson, we are using data collected by USGS stream guage 06730200 which
is located in Boulder Creek at North 75th St. This guage is one of the few the 
was able to collect data throughout the 2013 Boulder Floods. The data were that 
we will use were downloaded from USGS's 
<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis" target="_blank"> National 
Water Information System portal </a>.

You can access these data and the full available data stream for the boulder 
guage using the link below. Notice that youare able to download the data at 
different time periods as well!

#Import USGS Stream Discharge Data Into R
Now that we better understand the data that we will work with, let's import it into
`R`. First, open up the `precip-discharge/2013-discharge.txt` file in a text editor.
What do you notice about the structure of the file?

The first 25 lines are descriptive text and not actual data. Also notice that 
this file is separated by tabs, not commas. We will need to specify the **Tab delimiter**
when we import our data.We will use the `read.csv` to import it into an `R` object. 

When we use `csv` we need to define several attributes of the file including:

1. The data are tab delimited. We will this tell R to use the `"/t"` **sep**arator. 
Which defines a tab delimited separation.
2. The first group of lines in the file are not data, we will tell `R` to skip
those lines when it imports the data using `skip=25`.
3. Our data have a header, which is similar to column names in a spreadsheet. We 
will tell `R` to set `header=TRUE` to ensure the headers are imported as column
names rather than data values.
4. Finally we will set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to ensure our data come in a 
individual values.

Let's import our data.

## Import Stream Discharge Data
```{r import-discharge-2 }
#SOURCE
#http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv/?cb_00065=on&cb_00060=on&format=rdb&site_no=06730200&period=&begin_date=2013-01-01&end_date=2013-12-31
#import data

discharge <- read.csv("precip-discharge/2013-discharge.txt",
                      sep="\t",
                      skip=25,
                      header=TRUE,
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#view first few lines
head(discharge)


```

When we import these data, it appears as if we have 2 header rows rather than
one. Let's create a new `R` object that removes the second row of header values.
To do this, we can use select all data beginning at row 2 and ending at the
total number or rows in the file. The `nrow` function will count the total
number of rows in the object.

# LINK OUT TO DATA OR SOFTWARE CARPENTRY LESSONS THAT TEACH THIS??
* More on selecting a subset of a data.frame in R



Let's subset our `discharge` object to remove the first row.

```{r remove-second-header }
#how many rows are in the R object
nrow(discharge)

#remove the first line from the data frame (which is a second list of headers)
#the code below selects all rows beginning at row 2 and ending at the total
#number of rows. 
boulderStrDis.2013 <- discharge[2:nrow(discharge),]
```

Now, we have an `R` object that contains only rows containing data values. Each 
column also has a unique column name. However the column names may not be descriptive
enough. In some cases, when we had useful metadata, we might keep the names as is.
In this case, let's rename column 5, which contains the discharge value, **disValue**
so it is more "human readable" as we work with it in `R`.

```{r rename-headers }

#view names
names(boulderStrDis.2013)

#rename the fifth column to disValue representing discharge value
names(boulderStrDis.2013)[5] <- "disValue"

#view names
names(boulderStrDis.2013)

```

#View Data Structure
Let's have a look at the structure of our data. It appears as if the discharge 
value is a `character` class. This is likely because we had an additional row in our
data. Let's convert the discharge column to a `numeric` class. In this case, we can 
reassign that column to be of class: `integer` given there are no decimal places.

```{r adjust-data-structure }
#view structure of data
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

#view class of the disValue column
class(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)

#convert column to integer
boulderStrDis.2013$disValue <- as.integer(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)

class(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

```


#Converting Time Stamps
We have converted our discharge data to an `integer` class However the time stamp
field, `datetime` is still a `character` class. We could try to plot the data however, 
if we do, it will confuse R. It will read in the dates as character strings and
get confused. Your plot will take a LONG time to render!


```{r plot-flood-data-example, echo=FALSE }
#this plot takes FOREVER to create with all of the rows, so we will just 
#show them the output. OTherwise it could hang up machines.
ggplot(boulderStrDis.2013, aes(datetime, disValue)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Plot Data With Time Field as a Character Class\nNotice the X Axis Labels") +
  xlab("Date Time (Character Class)") + ylab("Discharge (CFS)")

```

To efficiently plot time series data, let's convert the `datetime` column to a 
`time` class for efficient plotting and analysis.

```{r convert-time }
#view class
class(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime)

#convert to date/time class - POSIX
boulderStrDis.2013$datetime <- as.POSIXct(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime)

#recheck data structure
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

```

#No Data Values
Next, let's query our data to check whether there are no data values (`NA`) in it.


```{r no-data-values }
#make sure there are no null values in our datetime field
sum(is.na(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime ))

```

#Plot The Data
Finally, we are ready to plot our data. We will use `GGPLOT` to create our plot.

```{r plot-flood-data }

ggplot(boulderStrDis.2013, aes(datetime, disValue)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nJan. 2013-Jan. 2014") +
  xlab("Date (POSIX Time Class)") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)")

```

#Plot Data Time Subsets With ggplot 

We can plot a subset of our data using `ggplot`. Let's plot data for the months 
directly around the boulder flood: August 2013 - October 2013.

```{r define-time-subset }

#Define Start and end times for the subset as R objects that are the time class
startTime <- as.POSIXct("2013-08-15 00:00:00")
endTime <- as.POSIXct("2013-10-15 00:00:00")

#create a start and end time R object
start.end <- c(startTime,endTime)
start.end
```

## Plot A Temporal Subset

Finally, we can use GGPLOT just like we did above to create a new plot. However, 
this time, we will use the `scale_x_datetime` method and define the limits to our
`limits` object.


ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nJan. 2013-Jan. 2014") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second")
  
```{r plot-subset }
#plot the data - September-October
ggplot(data=boulderStrDis.2013,
      aes(datetime,disValue)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_datetime(limits=start.end) +
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)") +
      ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nAugust 2013 - October 2013")


```

#Publish to Plot.ly
We have now successfully created a plot. We can turn that plot into an interactive
plot using `Plot.ly` if we want. Note, for this to be successful you need to 
set your Plot.ly API key which you will get from your free online account, once 
you create it.

Set your username: `Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="yourUserNameHere")`
Set your user key: `Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="yourUserKeyHere")`

##Time subsets in plot.ly

Note that plot.ly doesn't accept the ggplot time subset method. Thus we will
have to manually subset out our data.

```{r plotly-discharge-data, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)

#set username
Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="yourUserNameHere")
#set user key
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="yourUserKeyHere")

#subset out some of the data - July-November
boulderStrDis.aug.oct2013 <- subset(boulderStrDis.2013, 
                        datetime >= as.POSIXct('2013-08-15 00:00',
                                              tz = "America/Denver") & 
                        datetime <= as.POSIXct('2013-10-15 23:59', 
                                              tz = "America/Denver"))

#plot the data - September-October
disPlot.plotly <- ggplot(data=boulderStrDis.aug.oct2013,
        aes(datetime,disValue)) +
        geom_point(size=3) 
      
#add title and labels
disPlot.plotly <- disPlot.plotly + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
          xlab("Time") + ylab("Stream Discharge CFS") +
          ggtitle("Stream Discharge - Boulder Creek 2013")

#view plotly plot in R
ggplotly()

#publish plotly plot to your plot.ly online account if you want. 
#plotly_POST(disPlot.plotly)

```

#Challenge ???
* Maybe have them grab data from another location - possibly another guage that
survived the flood in another area??

#LEFT TO DO IN THIS LESSSON
1. Create Plot.ly plot in a neondataskills account and embed it as a graphic
2. Create challenge?
