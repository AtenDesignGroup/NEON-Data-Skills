## Summary Commands for the GitHub Forking Workflow

## First Time Use

### Fork a GitHub Repository
This creates your own copy of the desired repository on GitHub.com.

On the GitHub.com website:

* Navigate to desired repo that you want to fork
* Click Fork button
* If desired, rename fork.

### Create Your Local Repo

This allows you to work on your computer (locally) on any documents in your 
forked repo. 

On the GitHub.com website:

* Copy URL of the repo you want to work on locally

In bash

* `git clone URLhere`

## Repeated Use - Start Here

**Always start a new round of edits with updating your local copy -- see Pull Requests below**

### Add & Commit Changes 

On your computer, within your local copy of the git repository:

* Modify, create, or delete document(s) or repo structure.

In bash

* `git status` - check what is what
* `git add FileNameHere` - add files w/ changes
* `git status` - make sure everything is added and ready for commit
* `git commit -m “messageHere”` - all added files now in Git version control

### Syncing Repos

On the GitHub.com website:

* **Pull Request**: Update Your Fork from the Master
  + Button: Create New Pull Request
  + Set base: your fork, set head: master Institute repo
  + Make sure changes are what you want to sync
  + Button: Create Pull Request
  + Add Pull Request title & comments
  + Button: Create Pull Request
  + Button: Merge Pull Request

In bash

* Update your Local Repo & Push Changes
  + `git pull` - pull down any changes and sync the local repo with your fork
  + Fix any merge conflicts -- hopefully none!
  + `git push origin gh-pages` - move your edits from your computer (local) to your fork 

On the GitHub.com website:

* **Pull Request**: Update from Your Fork to the Master
  * Button: Create New Pull Request
  * Set base: master Institute repo, set head: your Fork
  * Make sure changes are what you want to sync
  * Button: Create Pull Request
  * Add Pull Request title & comments
  * Button: Create Pull Request
  * Button: Merge Pull Request - only if you have contributor permissions

### Before Starting a New Round of Edits

Always perform a pull request to sync your fork with the master repo and pull 
the changes to your computer (local) repository, prior to starting a new round 
of changes.  

This will prevent your from creating *dreaded* merge conflicts!
