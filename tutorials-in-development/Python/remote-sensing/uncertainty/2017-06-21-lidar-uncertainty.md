# Background

In 2016 the NEON AOP flew the PRIN site in D11 on a poor weather day to 
ensure coverage of the site. The following day, the weather improved and the 
site was flown again to collect good weather spectrometer data. Having 
collections only one day apart provides an opportunity to assess LiDAR 
uncertainty because we should expect that nothing has chnaged between the 
two collects. In this exercise we will analyze the several NEON Level 3 LIDAR rasters to 
assess the uncertainty.

## Start 

First, we'll set up our system and then . 
```python
import sys
sys.version
```


    '3.4.5 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 14:53:07) [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AMD64)]'


```python
import gdal
import h5py
import numpy as np
from math import floor
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

Define plotting function. This time we've added an input for the colormap limits.


```python
def plot_band_array(band_array,image_extent,title,cmap_title,colormap,colormap_limits):
    plt.imshow(diff_dsm_array,extent=image_extent)
    cbar = plt.colorbar(); plt.set_cmap(colormap); plt.clim(colormap_limits)
    cbar.set_label(cmap_title,rotation=270,labelpad=20)
    plt.title(title); ax = plt.gca()
    ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain') 
    rotatexlabels = plt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(),rotation=90)
```


```python
print('Start Uncertainty Script')
```

    Start Uncertainty Script
    

Define all of the input files. This will include two Digital Surface Model 
(DSMs) tifs from the flight days, two Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the 
flight days, and a single Canopy Height Model (CHM). In this case, all input 
GeoTIFF rasters are a single tile of the site that measures 1000 m by 1000 m.


```python
dsm1_filename = 'C:/RSDI_2017/data/PRIN/2016_PRIN_1_607000_3696000_DSM.tif'
dsm2_filename = 'C:/RSDI_2017/data/PRIN/2016_PRIN_2_607000_3696000_DSM.tif'
dtm1_filename = 'C:/RSDI_2017/data/PRIN/2016_PRIN_1_607000_3696000_DTM.tif'
dtm2_filename = 'C:/RSDI_2017/data/PRIN/2016_PRIN_2_607000_3696000_DTM.tif'
chm_filename = 'C:/RSDI_2017/data/PRIN/2016_PRIN_1_607000_3696000_pit_free_CHM.tif'
```

Open all of the files for accessing the data and meta data.


```python
dsm1_dataset = gdal.Open(dsm1_filename)
dsm2_dataset = gdal.Open(dsm2_filename)
dtm1_dataset = gdal.Open(dtm1_filename)
dtm2_dataset = gdal.Open(dtm2_filename)
chm_dataset = gdal.Open(chm_filename)
```

Next we will read the dimensions from the tif meta data for the first DSM. This 
includes the data columns, rows band numbers and mapping info.


```python
cols_dsm1 = dsm1_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_dsm1 = dsm1_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_dsm1 = dsm1_dataset.RasterCount
mapinfo_dsm1 = dsm1_dataset.GetGeoTransform()
```

Using the mapping information, we will determine the partial extents of the data 
by adding the number of columns and rows to the UTM northing and easting of the 
upper left corner. Since we know all the data is from the same tile, this data 
will be valid for all tiles. However, if you have tiles that are the same you 
would need to ensure that you are able to 


```python
xMin = mapinfo_dsm1[0]
yMax = mapinfo_dsm1[3]
xMax = xMin + chm_dataset.RasterXSize/mapinfo_dsm1[1]
yMin = yMax + chm_dataset.RasterYSize/mapinfo_dsm1[5]
image_extent = (xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
```

```python
print mapinfo_dsm1
```
     (607000.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3697000.0, 0.0, -1.0) 


We will now read in the meta data for the remaining tiles


```python
cols_dsm2 = dsm2_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_dsm2 = dsm2_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_dsm2 = dsm2_dataset.RasterCount

cols_dtm1 = dtm1_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_dtm1 = dtm1_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_dtm1 = dtm1_dataset.RasterCount

cols_dtm2 = dtm2_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_dtm2 = dtm2_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_dtm2 = dtm2_dataset.RasterCount

cols_chm = chm_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_chm = chm_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_chm = chm_dataset.RasterCount
```

Let's check all the datasets to make sure dimensions are equivalent as 
the following code will fail rasters of varied sizes are used. In this case, 
we will exit the script with a warning message.


```python
if (cols_dsm1 != cols_dsm2 or cols_dsm1 != cols_dtm1 or cols_dsm1 != cols_dtm2 or cols_dsm1 != cols_chm):
    sys.exit('Columns from datasets do not match')
       
if (rows_dsm1 != rows_dsm2 or rows_dsm1 != rows_dtm1 or rows_dsm1 != rows_dtm2 or rows_dsm1 != rows_chm):
    sys.exit('Rows from datasets do not match')
       
if (bands_dsm1 != 1 or bands_dsm2 != 1 or bands_dtm1 != 1 or bands_dtm2 != 1 or bands_chm != 1):
    sys.exit('There are the wrong number of bands in a dataset')

```

Next we'll assign the raster object for each dataset


```python
dsm1_raster = dsm1_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
dsm2_raster = dsm2_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
dtm1_raster = dtm1_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
dtm2_raster = dtm2_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
chm_raster = chm_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
```

...and the associated NoData values


```python
noDataVal_dsm1 = dsm1_raster.GetNoDataValue()
noDataVal_dsm2 = dsm2_raster.GetNoDataValue()
noDataVal_dtm1 = dtm1_raster.GetNoDataValue()
noDataVal_dtm2 = dtm2_raster.GetNoDataValue()
noDataVal_chm = chm_raster.GetNoDataValue()
```

Now we will read in the raster data as two-dimensional arrays with the float 
data type, and assign all NoData values as NaNs. We must convert these to 
NaNs as the NoData value will bias the statistics.


```python
dsm_array1 = dsm1_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_dsm1,rows_dsm1).astype(np.float)
dsm_array2 = dsm2_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_dsm2,rows_dsm2).astype(np.float)
dtm_array1 = dtm1_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_dsm1,rows_dsm1).astype(np.float)
dtm_array2 = dtm2_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_dsm2,rows_dsm2).astype(np.float)
chm_array = chm_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_chm,rows_chm).astype(np.float)

dsm_array1[dsm_array1==int(noDataVal_dsm1)]=np.nan 
dsm_array2[dsm_array2==int(noDataVal_dsm2)]=np.nan
dtm_array1[dtm_array1==int(noDataVal_dtm1)]=np.nan 
dtm_array2[dtm_array2==int(noDataVal_dtm2)]=np.nan 
chm_array[chm_array==int(noDataVal_chm)]=np.nan 
```

To get an estaimte of the DSM and DTM uncertainty, we now subtract the tiles 
that were acquired on the two different days


```python
diff_dsm_array = np.subtract(dsm_array1,dsm_array2)
diff_dtm_array = np.subtract(dtm_array1,dtm_array2) 
```

Let's get some summary statistics for the DSM difference...


```python
diff_dsm_array_mean = np.mean(diff_dsm_array)
diff_dsm_array_std = np.std(diff_dsm_array)
print('Mean difference in DSMs: ',round(diff_dsm_array_mean,3),' (m)')
print('Standard deviations of difference in DSMs: ',round(diff_dsm_array_std,3),' (m)')
```

    Mean difference in DSMs:  0.019  (m)
    Standard deviations of difference in DSMs:  0.743  (m)
    

As a result we get the following:
Mean difference in DSMs:  0.019  (m)
Standard deviations of difference in DSMs:  0.743  (m)
The mean is close to zero indicating there was very little systematic bias 
between the two days. However, we notice that the standard deviation of the 
data is quite high at 0.743 meters. Generally we expect NEON LiDAR data to have 
an error below 0.15 meters! Let's take a look at a histogram of the DSM 
difference. We use the flatten function on the 2D diff_dsm_array to convert 
it into a 1D array which allows the hist function to run faster.


```python
plt.figure(1)
plt.hist(diff_dsm_array.flatten(),100)
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DSM')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')
```

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xd908978>


![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_29_1.png)



The histogram has long tails, obscuring the distribution near the center. To 
constrain the x-limits of the histogram we will use the mean and standard 
deviation just calculated. Since the data appears to be normally distributed, 
we can constrain the histogram to 95% of the data by including two standard 
deviations above and below the mean.   


```python
plt.figure(1)
plt.hist(diff_dsm_array.flatten(),100,range=[diff_dsm_array_mean-2*diff_dsm_array_std, diff_dsm_array_mean+2*diff_dsm_array_std])
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DSM')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')
```


    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xd93c390>


![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_31_1.png)


The histogram shows a wide variation in DSM differences, with those at the 95% 
limit at around +/- 1.5 m. Let's take a look at the spatial distribution of the 
errors by plotting a map of the difference between the two DSMs. Here we'll also 
use the extra variable in the plot function to constrain the limits of the 
colorbar to 95% of the observations. 


```python
plt.figure(3)
plot_band_array(diff_dsm_array,image_extent,'DSM Difference','Difference (m)','bwr',[diff_dsm_array_mean-2*diff_dsm_array_std, diff_dsm_array_mean+2*diff_dsm_array_std])

```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_33_0.png)



It seems that there is a spatial pattern in the distribution of errors. Now 
let's take a look at the histogram and map for the difference in DTMs.


```python
diff_dtm_array_mean = np.nanmean(diff_dtm_array)
diff_dtm_array_std = np.nanstd(diff_dtm_array)
print('Mean difference in DTMs: ',round(diff_dtm_array_mean,3),' (m)')
print('Standard deviations of difference in DTMs: ',round(diff_dtm_array_std,3),' (m)') 

plt.figure(4)
plt.hist(diff_dtm_array.flatten()[~np.isnan(diff_dtm_array.flatten())],100,range=[diff_dtm_array_mean-2*diff_dtm_array_std, diff_dtm_array_mean+2*diff_dtm_array_std])
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DTM')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.figure(5)
plot_band_array(diff_dtm_array,image_extent,'DTM Difference','Difference (m)','bwr',[diff_dtm_array_mean-2*diff_dtm_array_std, diff_dtm_array_mean+2*diff_dtm_array_std])
```

    Mean difference in DTMs:  0.014  (m)
    Standard deviations of difference in DTMs:  0.102  (m)
    

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_35_1.png)


![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_35_2.png)


The overall magnitude of differences are smaller, but the same spatial pattern 
of the error is evident. Now, we'll plot the Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the 
same area. In the CHM, the tree heights above ground are represented, with all 
ground pixels having zero elevation. This time we'll use a colorbar which shows 
the ground as light gray and the highest vegetation as dark green. We can set 
the lower limit of the color bar to zero and the upper limit to the mean canopy 
height to get a good color variation. 


```python
chm_array_mean = np.nanmean(chm_array [ chm_array!=0])
chm_array_std = np.nanstd(chm_array)
plt.figure(6)
plot_band_array(chm_array,image_extent,'Canopy height Model','Canopy height (m)','Greens',[0, chm_array_mean])
plt.savefig('PRIN_CHM.png',dpi=300,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)
```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_37_0.png)


From the CHM, it appears the spatial distribution of error patterns follow the 
location of vegetation. Now let's isolate the only the pixels in the difference 
DSM that correspond to vegetation location, calcualte the mean and standard 
deviation and plot the associated histogram. Before displaying the histogram, 
we'll remove the no data values from the difference DSM and the non-zero pixels 
from the CHM. To keep the number of elements the same in each vector to allow 
element-wise logical operations in Python, we have to remove the difference 
DSM no data elements from the CHM array as well. 


```python
diff_dsm_array_veg_mean = np.nanmean(diff_dsm_array[chm_array!=0.0])
diff_dsm_array_veg_std = np.nanstd(diff_dsm_array[chm_array!=0.0])
plt.figure(7)
print('Mean difference in DSMs on veg points: ',round(diff_dsm_array_veg_mean,3),' (m)')
print('Standard deviations of difference in DSMs on veg points: ',round(diff_dsm_array_veg_std,3),' (m)')

plt.figure(8)
diff_dsm_array_nodata_removed = diff_dsm_array[~np.isnan(diff_dsm_array)]
chm_dsm_nodata_removed = chm_array[~np.isnan(diff_dsm_array)]
plt.hist(diff_dsm_array_nodata_removed[chm_dsm_nodata_removed!=0.0],100,range=[diff_dsm_array_veg_mean-2*diff_dsm_array_veg_std, diff_dsm_array_veg_mean+2*diff_dsm_array_veg_std])
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DSM (veg)')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')

```

    Mean difference in DSMs on veg points:  0.064  (m)
    Standard deviations of difference in DSMs on veg points:  1.381  (m)
    

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xe93aa58>



![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_39_2.png)


    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x93dfdd8>


The results show a similar mean difference of near zero, but an extremely 
high variation of 1.381 m! Since the DSM represents the top of the tree canopy, 
this provides the level of uncertainty we can expect in the canopy height in 
forests characteristic of the PRIN site using NEON LiDAR data. Next we'll 
calculate the statistics and plot the histogram of the DTM vegetated areas.


```python
diff_dtm_array_veg_mean = np.nanmean(diff_dtm_array[chm_array!=0.0])
diff_dtm_array_veg_std = np.nanstd(diff_dtm_array[chm_array!=0.0])
plt.figure(9)
print('Mean difference in DTMs on veg points: ',round(diff_dtm_array_veg_mean,3),' (m)')
print('Standard deviations of difference in DTMs on veg points: ',round(diff_dtm_array_veg_std,3),' (m)')

plt.figure(10)
diff_dtm_array_nodata_removed = diff_dtm_array[~np.isnan(diff_dtm_array)] 
chm_dtm_nodata_removed = chm_array[~np.isnan(diff_dtm_array)]
plt.hist((diff_dtm_array_nodata_removed[chm_dtm_nodata_removed!=0.0]),100,range=[diff_dtm_array_veg_mean-2*diff_dtm_array_veg_std, diff_dtm_array_veg_mean+2*diff_dtm_array_veg_std])
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DTM (veg)')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')
```

    Mean difference in DTMs on veg points:  0.023  (m)
    Standard deviations of difference in DTMs on veg points:  0.163  (m)
    

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xb182a20>

    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x96620f0>


![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_41_3.png)


Here we can see that the mean difference is almost zero at 0.003 m, and the 
variation in less than the DSM at 0.257 m. Although the variation is reduced, 
it is still larger than expected for LiDAR. This is because under vegetation 
there may not be much laser energy reaching the ground, and those points that 
do may return with lower signal. The sparsity of points leads to surface 
interpolation over larger areas which can miss variations in the topography. 
Since the distribution of LIDAR and their location varied for each day, this 
resulted in different terrain representations and a uncertianty in the ground 
surface. This shows that the accuracy of LiDAR DTMs is reduced when under 
vegetation. Finally, let's look at the DTM difference on only the ground points 
(where CHM = 0).


```python
diff_dtm_array_ground_mean = np.nanmean(diff_dtm_array[chm_array==0.0])
diff_dtm_array_ground_std = np.nanstd(diff_dtm_array[chm_array==0.0])
print('Mean difference in DTMs on ground points: ',round(diff_dtm_array_ground_mean,3),' (m)')
print('Standard deviations of difference in DTMs on ground points: ',round(diff_dtm_array_ground_std,3),' (m)')

plt.figure(11)
plt.hist((diff_dtm_array_nodata_removed[chm_dtm_nodata_removed==0.0]),100,range=[diff_dtm_array_ground_mean-2*diff_dtm_array_ground_std, diff_dtm_array_ground_mean+2*diff_dtm_array_ground_std])
plt.title('Histogram of PRIN DTM (ground)')
plt.xlabel('Height Difference(m)'); plt.ylabel('Frequency')

```

    Mean difference in DTMs on ground points:  0.011  (m)
    Standard deviations of difference in DTMs on ground points:  0.068  (m)
    

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xe939240>

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/lidar-uncertainty/output_43_2.png)


In the open ground scenario we are able to produce the error chatracteristics 
we expect with a mean difference of only 0.011 m and a variation of 0.068 m. 
This shows that the uncertainty we expect in the NEON LiDAR system (~0.15 m) 
is only valid in bare open, har surface scenarios. We cannot expect the accuracy 
of the LiDAR to reach this level when vegetation is present. Quantifying the top 
of the canopy is particularly difficult and can lead to uncertainty in excess of 
1 m for any given pixel.
