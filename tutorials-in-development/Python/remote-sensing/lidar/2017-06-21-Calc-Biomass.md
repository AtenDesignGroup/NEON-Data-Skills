## Background

In this tutorial, we will calculate the biomass for a section of the SJER site. We 
will be using the Canopy Height Model discrete LiDAR data product as well as 
field data collected by the TOS group at NEON. This tutorial will calculate Biomass 
for individual trees in the forest. 

The calculation of biomass consists of four primary steps:

1. Delineating individual tree crowns
2. Calculating predictor variables for all individuals
3. Collecting training data
4. Applying a regression model to estiamte biomass from predictors

In this tutorial we will use a watershed segmentation algorithm for delineating 
tree crowns (step 1) and and a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for 
relating the predictor variables to biomass (part 4). The predictor variables were 
selected following suggestions by Gleason et al. (2012) and biomass estimates were 
determined from DBH (diamter at breast height) measurements following relationships 
given in Jenkins et al. (2003). 

## Get Started

First, we will import several of the typical libraries. 


```python
import numpy as np
import os
import gdal, osr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ndimage as ndi
%matplotlib inline 
```

Next we will add libraries from skilearn which will help with the watershed 
delineation, determination of predictor variables and random forest algorithm.


```python
#Import biomass specific libraries
from skimage.morphology import watershed
from skimage.feature import peak_local_max
from skimage.measure import regionprops
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
```

Define a function that will allow us to plot our spatial data.


```python
#Define plot band array function

def plot_band_array(band_array,image_extent,title,cmap_title,colormap,colormap_limits):
    plt.imshow(band_array,extent=image_extent)
    cbar = plt.colorbar(); plt.set_cmap(colormap); plt.clim(colormap_limits)
    cbar.set_label(cmap_title,rotation=270,labelpad=20)
    plt.title(title); ax = plt.gca()
    ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain') 
    rotatexlabels = plt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(),rotation=90)

```

Define a function that will allow us to output GeoTIFF files.


```python
def array2raster(newRasterfn,rasterOrigin,pixelWidth,pixelHeight,array,epsg):

    cols = array.shape[1]
    rows = array.shape[0]
    originX = rasterOrigin[0]
    originY = rasterOrigin[1]

    driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('GTiff')
    outRaster = driver.Create(newRasterfn, cols, rows, 1, gdal.GDT_Float32)
    outRaster.SetGeoTransform((originX, pixelWidth, 0, originY, 0, pixelHeight))
    outband = outRaster.GetRasterBand(1)
    outband.WriteArray(array)
    outRasterSRS = osr.SpatialReference()
    outRasterSRS.ImportFromEPSG(epsg)
    outRaster.SetProjection(outRasterSRS.ExportToWkt())
    outband.FlushCache()
    
```

Now we will define the file path to our CHM file.


```python
chm_file = 'C:/RSDI_2017/Day4/Biomass/NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_256000_4106000_CHM.tif'
```

We will want to output the results with the same file information as the input, 
so we will gather the file name information.


```python
#Get info from chm file for outputting results
just_chm_file = os.path.basename(chm_file)
just_chm_file_split = just_chm_file.split(sep="_")
```


```python
#Open the CHM file with GDAL
chm_dataset = gdal.Open(chm_file)

#Get the raster band object
chm_raster = chm_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)

#Get the NO DATA value
noDataVal_chm = chm_raster.GetNoDataValue()

#Get required metadata from CHM file
cols_chm = chm_dataset.RasterXSize
rows_chm = chm_dataset.RasterYSize
bands_chm = chm_dataset.RasterCount
mapinfo_chm =chm_dataset.GetGeoTransform()
xMin = mapinfo_chm[0]
yMax = mapinfo_chm[3]
xMax = xMin + chm_dataset.RasterXSize/mapinfo_chm[1]
yMin = yMax + chm_dataset.RasterYSize/mapinfo_chm[5]
image_extent = (xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
```

Now we will get the CHM data, plot it and save the figure.


```python
#Plot the original CHM
plt.figure(1)
chm_array = chm_raster.ReadAsArray(0,0,cols_chm,rows_chm).astype(np.float)

#PLot the CHM figure
plot_band_array(chm_array,image_extent,'Canopy height Model','Canopy height (m)','Greens',[0, 9])
plt.savefig(just_chm_file_split[0]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[1]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[2]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[3]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[4]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[5]+'_'+'CHM.png',dpi=300,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)

```

Now we will run a Gaussian smoothing kernal (convolution) across the data set to 
remove spurious high vegetation points. This will help ensure we are finding 
the treetops properly before running the watershed segmentation algorithm. For 
different forest types it may be necessary to change the input parameters. 
Information on the function can be found at 
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian_filter.html" target="_blank"> SciPy Docs</a>. 

Of most importance are the second and fourth inputs. The second input defines 
the standard deviation of the Gaussian smoothing kernal. Too large a value will 
apply too much smoothing, to small and some spurious high points may be left 
behind. The truncate value controls after how many standard deviations the 
Gaussian kernal will get cut off (since it theoretically goes to infinity).


```python
#Smooth the CHM using a gaussian filter to remove spurious points
chm_array_smooth = ndi.gaussian_filter(chm_array,2,mode='constant',cval=0,truncate=2.0)
chm_array_smooth[chm_array==0] = 0 
```

Now save a copy of filtered CHM.


```python
#Save the smoothed CHM
array2raster('C:/RSDI_2017/Day4/Biomass/chm_filter.tif',(xMin,yMax),1,-1,np.array(chm_array_smooth/10000,dtype=float),32611)
```

Now we will run an algorithm to determine local maximums within the image. 
Setting indices to 'False' returns a raster of the maximum points, as opposed 
to a list of coordinates. The footprint parameter is an area where only a 
single peak can be found. This should be approximately the size of the smallest 
tree. Information on more sophisticated methods to define the window can be 
found in Chen (2006).  


```python
#Calculate local maximum points in the smoothed CHM
local_maxi = peak_local_max(chm_array_smooth,indices=False, footprint=np.ones((5, 5)))
```

Plot the raster of local maximums. The following figure shows the difference in 
finding local maximums for a filtered vs. non-filtered CHM.

</figure>



```python
#Plot the local maximums
plt.figure(2)
plot_band_array(local_maxi,image_extent,'Maximum','Maxi','Greys',[0, 1])
plt.savefig(just_chm_file_split[0]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[1]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[2]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[3]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[4]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[5]+'_'+'Maximums.png',dpi=300,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)

```

Apply labels to all of the local maximum points


```python
#Identify all the maximum points
markers = ndi.label(local_maxi)[0]
```

Next we will create a mask layer of all of the vegettion points so that the 
watershed segmentation will only occur on the trees and not extend into the 
surrounding ground points. Since 0 represent ground points in the CHM, setting 
the mask to 1 where the CHM is not zero will define the mask.


```python
#Create a CHM mask so the segmentation will only occur on the trees
chm_mask = chm_array_smooth
chm_mask[chm_array_smooth != 0] = 1
```

Next we will perfrom the watershed segmentation, which produces a raster of labels.


```python
#Perfrom watershed segmentation        
labels = watershed(chm_array_smooth, markers, mask=chm_mask)
```

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Now we will get several properties of the individual trees which are used as predictor variables.


```python
#Get the properties of each segment
tree_properties = regionprops(labels,chm_array, ['Area','BoundingBox','Centroid','Orientation','MajorAxisLength','MinorAxisLength','MaxIntensity','MinIntensity'])
```

It was found that occasionally the segmenting skippen an integer number. We want 
to be able to match our segments to the trees in later steps, so we will 
create an array with only the segment numbers used.


```python
#Determine how many individual trees were identified
max_labels = labels.max()
segment_labels = np.zeros(max_labels+1)
segment_id = np.zeros(max_labels+1)

for counter in range (1,max_labels+1):
    segment_labels[counter] = len(labels[labels==counter])
    segment_id[counter]=counter
    
#Remove the non-zero elements
segment_id = segment_id[np.nonzero(segment_labels)]
 

```

Next we will save the segments as a GeoTIFF and plot them.


```python
#Change the lebels to flow and plot them and save as raster
labels = np.array((labels),dtype=float)
plt.figure(3)
array2raster('C:/RSDI_2017/Day4/Biomass/SegmentedData.tif',(xMin,yMax),1,-1,labels,32611)
#Change the zero labels to nans so they won't show up in the plot
labels[labels==0] = np.nan
      
#Plot the segments      
plot_band_array(labels,image_extent,'Crown Segmentation','Tree Crown Number','Spectral',[0, max_labels])
plt.savefig(just_chm_file_split[0]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[1]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[2]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[3]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[4]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[5]+'_'+'Segmentation.png',dpi=300,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)


```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/py-figs/calc-biomass-py/output_34_0.png)


Now we will define the predictor variables and begin to fill out their values.


```python
#Define several of the predictor variables
area=np.zeros(len(tree_properties))
diameter=np.zeros(len(tree_properties))
max_tree_height=np.zeros(len(tree_properties))
min_tree_height=np.zeros(len(tree_properties))

#Retreive the predictor variables from the region properties
for counter in range(0,len(tree_properties)):
    
    area[counter] = tree_properties[counter]['Area']
    diameter[counter] = tree_properties[counter]['MajorAxisLength']        
    max_tree_height[counter] =  tree_properties[counter]['MaxIntensity']    
    min_tree_height[counter] = tree_properties[counter]['MinIntensity']  

```

Now we will define the remaining predictor variables 


```python
#Define the remaining predictor variables

crown_geometric_volume_full=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
crown_geometric_volume_50th_percentile=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
crown_geometric_volume_60th_percentile=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
crown_geometric_volume_70th_percentile=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
percentile_50th=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
percentile_60th=np.zeros(len(segment_id))
percentile_70th=np.zeros(len(segment_id))

```

We will now run through a loop of all tree segments and gather the remaining 
predictor variables which include height percentiles and crown geometric 
volume percentiles. Inside the loop, we use logical indexing to retrieve 
each individual tree. We then calculate our predictor variables of interest. 


```python
#Cycle through all of the tree segments    
counter=0
for segment in segment_id:
    #Pull out the tree of interest
    indexes_of_tree = np.asarray(np.where(labels==segment)).T
    tree_data = chm_array[indexes_of_tree[:,0],indexes_of_tree[:,1]]
    #Calculate the geometric volume 
    crown_geometric_volume_full[counter]=np.sum([tree_data-np.min(tree_data)])
    
    #Pull out 50th percentile stats
    percentile_50th[counter]=np.percentile(tree_data,50)
    tree_data_50th = chm_array[indexes_of_tree[:,0],indexes_of_tree[:,1]]
    tree_data_50th[tree_data_50th>percentile_50th[counter]] = percentile_50th[counter]
    crown_geometric_volume_50th_percentile[counter]=np.sum([tree_data_50th-min_tree_height[counter]])
    
    #Pull out 60th percentile stats    
    percentile_60th[counter]=np.percentile(tree_data,60)
    tree_data_60th = chm_array[indexes_of_tree[:,0],indexes_of_tree[:,1]]
    tree_data_60th[tree_data_60th>percentile_60th[counter]] = percentile_60th[counter]
    crown_geometric_volume_60th_percentile[counter]=np.sum([tree_data_60th-min_tree_height[counter]])
    
    #Pull out 60th percentile stats 
    percentile_70th[counter]=np.percentile(tree_data,70)
    tree_data_70th = chm_array[indexes_of_tree[:,0],indexes_of_tree[:,1]]
    tree_data_70th[tree_data_70th>percentile_70th[counter]] = percentile_70th[counter]
    crown_geometric_volume_70th_percentile[counter]=np.sum([tree_data_70th-min_tree_height[counter]])
        
    counter=counter+1
```

We now bring in the training data file which is a simple .csv file with no 
header. The first column is biomass, and the remaining columns are the same 
predictor variables defined above. The tree diameter and max height were defined 
in the TOS data along with the DBH. The field validated values are used for 
training, while the other were determined from the CHM and camera images by 
manually delineating the tree crowns and pulling out the relevant information 
from the CHM. Biomass was calculated from DBH accordaing to the formulas in 
Jenkins et al. (2003).  


```python
#Define the file of training data  
training_data_file = 'C:/RSDI_2017/Day4/Biomass/training/SJER_Biomass_Training.csv'

#Read in the training data from a CSV file
training_data = np.genfromtxt(training_data_file,delimiter=',') 

#Grab the biomass (Y) from the first line
biomass = training_data[:,0]

#Grab the biomass prdeictors from the remaining lines
biomass_predictors = training_data[:,1:12]
    
```

We then define paraemters of the Random Forest classifier and fit the predictor 
variables from the training data to the Biomass estaimtes.


```python
#Define paraemters for Random forest regressor
max_depth = 30

#Define regressor rules
regr_rf = RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=max_depth, random_state=2)

#Fit the biomass to regressor variables
regr_rf.fit(biomass_predictors,biomass)

```




    RandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, criterion='mse', max_depth=30,
               max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
               min_impurity_split=1e-07, min_samples_leaf=1,
               min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
               n_estimators=10, n_jobs=1, oob_score=False, random_state=2,
               verbose=0, warm_start=False)



Now we will gather the predictor variables gathered from all the segmented trees 
into a single array.


```python
#Stack the predictor variables for all the individual trees
all_training_data = np.stack([area,diameter,max_tree_height,min_tree_height,percentile_50th,percentile_60th,percentile_70th,crown_geometric_volume_full,crown_geometric_volume_50th_percentile,crown_geometric_volume_60th_percentile,crown_geometric_volume_70th_percentile],axis=-1)

```

We know apply the Random Forest model to the predictor variables to retreive 
biomass.


```python
#Apply the model to the 
pred_biomass = regr_rf.predict(all_training_data)
```

For outputting a raster, copy the labels raster to a biomass raster, then 
cycle through the segments and assign the biomass estaimte to each individual 
tree segment.


```python
#Set an out raster with the same size as the labels
biomass_out = labels

#Set counter to zero
counter = 0
#Assign each tree by the associated biomass
for segment in segment_id:
    biomass_out[biomass_out==segment] = pred_biomass[counter]
    counter = counter+1
```

Collect some of the biomass statistics and then plot the results and save an 
output GeoTIFF.


```python
#Get biomass stats for plotting
mean_biomass = np.mean(pred_biomass)
std_biomass = np.std(pred_biomass)
min_biomass = np.min(pred_biomass)
sum_biomass = np.sum(pred_biomass)

print('Sum of biomass is ',sum_biomass,' kg')

#Plot the biomass!
plt.figure(5)
plot_band_array(biomass_out,image_extent,'Biomass (kg)','Biomass (kg)','winter',[min_biomass+std_biomass, mean_biomass+std_biomass*3])
plt.savefig(just_chm_file_split[0]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[1]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[2]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[3]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[4]+'_'+just_chm_file_split[5]+'_'+'Biomass.png',dpi=300,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)
array2raster('biomass.tif',(xMin,yMax),1,-1,np.array(biomass_out,dtype=float),32611)

```

    Sum of biomass is  6978251.34548  kg
