The Day 1 Lesson (Jupyter Notebooks) were designed in the following order:

1. intro_neon_aop_hyperspectral_python.ipynb
2. hdf5_hyperspectral_functions.ipynb
3. plot_spectral_signatures.ipynb
4. calculate_ndvi_extract_spectra_with_masks.ipynb

Data, once uploaded should be stored under the Remote-Sensing-Python folder, or the paths to access data will need to be modified in the notebook scripts.
I am still updating and adding functions to the neon_aop.py module that is loaded at the start of lessons 2-4, but all functions required to run the notebooks should already be uploaded.
