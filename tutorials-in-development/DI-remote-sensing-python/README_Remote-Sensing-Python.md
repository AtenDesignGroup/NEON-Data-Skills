# NEON Lesson Building Repository - Remote Sensing Python
This is a development repository for the
<a href="http://www.neondataskills.org" target="_blank">NEON Data Skills portal</a>. 
Here the NEON Data Skills team develops and builds new content. Content is 
transferred to the NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills repository to be published. 

This directory will contain all the code related to the Remote Sensing Python
lessons originally created for Data Institute 2017. 


## Other associated directories

*`images/Remote-Sensing-Python/...`: each series/lesson will have a subdirectory with the same naming/file
path as in the `_posts` directory. This allows for organized and automated 
creation of files and embedding the images in the files.  
* `code/Remote-Sensing-Python/...`: this directory (same file paths inside) will contain any code that 
should be downloadable with the lesson via the "Download code" button at the 
bottom of each tutorial page.
