This tutorial will guide you through comparing a Lidar-based canopy height 
model to ground measurements of tree height, using NEON data products. 
Along the way, we will refer to other NEON tools and tutorials that may be 
useful to you, and cover some of the basics of working with the `raster` 
package in R.
