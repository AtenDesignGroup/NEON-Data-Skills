In this tutorial you will learn how to open and work with NEON Hyperspectral 
Remote Sensing data that are delivered in HDF5 format. Note that this tutorial
currently outlines out to access the data in the HDF5 format used prior to 2017. 
The exact pathways may be different for the reformatted data now available from 
NEON.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Understand how HDF5 files can be created and structured in R using the rhfd libraries. 
* Understand the three key HDF5 elements: 
		* the HDF5 file itself,
		* groups,and 
		* datasets.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### R Libraries to Install:

* **rhdf5** 
* **raster**
* **rgdal**


### Download Data

The datasets here is used for all the Data Institute 2016 tutorials. If you are
only completing this tutorial you will only need the TEAK dataset. 

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Data-Institute-16-TEAK.html %}

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Data-Institute-16-SJER.html %}

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Data-Institute-16-SOAP.html %}

## Recommended Background 

Consider reviewing the documentation for the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/rhdf5/man/rhdf5.pdf" target="_blank">RHDF5 package</a>.

</div>


First, let's load the required libraries.

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE }
# load libraries
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
library(rgdal)

# set wd
# setwd("~/Documents/data/NEONDI-2016") #Mac
# setwd("~/data/NEONDI-2016")  # Windows
```

## Explore HDF5 Files

Now we can read in the data and , define the file name and view the file structure using the `H5ls()` function.

```{r read-file, results='hide'}
# define the file name as an object
f <- "NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/spectrometer/reflectance/Subset3NIS1_20130614_100459_atmcor.h5"

# view the structure of the H5 file
h5ls(f, all = TRUE)

```


## View Data Attributes

Data stored within an H5 file is referred to as a **dataset**. Metadata for each
item in an H5 file is referred to as an **attribute**. 

Let's view the attributes for the `map info` dataset within the NEON H5 file. 
Map Info contains some key coordinate reference system information, including 
the UPPER LEFT corner coordinate in UTM (meters) of the Reflectance data.

```{r view-attributes }

# View map info attributes
mapInfo <- h5read(f, "map info", read.attributes = TRUE)
mapInfo

```

Here we can see the units, coordinates, and CRS info. 

## Get Scale Factor

Next, let's extract the data scale factor from the H5 attributes. Notice the
data ignore value is stored in a character format. NEON will be fixing in the
next file format update. 

```{r view-attr }

# r  get attributes for the Reflectance dataset
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f, "Reflectance")
reflInfo

# view the data ignore value
reflInfo$`data ignore value`
class(reflInfo$`data ignore value`)

```

## Get Shape/Extent

Let's read the data to grab the dimensions. These are not currently attributes
so we need to open the H5 file to view them. Note: In the next format update, 
NEON will have the dimensions as attributes that you can automatically them pull
in.

```{r import-reflectance }

# open the file for viewing (H5Fopen = H5 file open
fid <- H5Fopen(f)

# open the reflectance dataset (H5Dopen = H5 dataset open)
did <- H5Dopen(fid, "Reflectance")
did

# grab the dimensions of the object
sid <- H5Dget_space(did)
sid

dims <- H5Sget_simple_extent_dims(sid)$size
dims

# take note that the data seem to come in rotated; wavelength is the
# THIRD dimension rather than the first. Columns are the FIRST dimension, 
# then rows.

# close everything
H5close() 

```

<div id="ds-dataTip">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip:** If you get an error with the file being 
"open" just use the generic H5 close function: `H5close()`. 
</div>


## View Wavelength Information

Next, let's look at the wavelengths for each band in our hyperspectral dataset.
How many bands does our data contain?

```{r import-wavelength}

# import the center wavelength in nanometers (um) of each "band"
wavelengths<- h5read(f,"wavelength")

# view wavelength structure
str(wavelengths)

```

## Read Reflectance Data

Once we know the dimensions of the data, we can more efficiently **slice** out
chunks or subsets of our data out. The power of HDF5 is that it allows us to
store large heterogeneous data. However, we can quickly and efficiently access
those data through "slicing" or extracting subsets of the data.

Let's grab reflectance data for **Band 56** only.

```{r read-refl-data }

# Extract or "slice" data for band 56 from the HDF5 file
b56 <- h5read(f, # file
							"Reflectance",  # dataset of interest
							index=list(1:dims[1], 1:dims[2], 56)) # what to subset

# note the data come in as an array
class(b56)

```

## Convert to Matrix

Next, we will convert the data to a matrix and then to a raster.
We don't need an array (which is a multi-dimensional object) because our data
are only 2 dimensions at this point (1 single band).

```{r view-data }
# Convert from array to matrix so we can plot and convert to a raster
b56 <- b56[,,1]

# what happens when we plot?
# plot the data
image(b56)
```

That's a bit dark. Let's look at the distribuiton of values in our image. 

```{r image-hist}

# set for non-scientific notation
options("scipen"=100, "digits"=4)

hist(b56,
     col="springgreen",
     main="Distribution of Reflectance Values \nBand 56")

```

Given this range of values a log transformation of our day may allow us to 
get a better visualization of the image. We can apply a logarithmic transformation
to the data. 

```{r apply-stretch}

image(log(b56),
			main="Band 56 with log Transformation")
# view distribution of reflectance data

```

That looks better. The figures below describe what a strech does to the image.

    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a
    darker image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to
    the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of
    the image.

## Data Clean-up

We have now imported some reflectance data for Band 56 into R. However, we need 
to do a bit of cleanup including:

1. Set the **no data value** to 15,000.
2. Apply the **scale factor** to the data (10,000).

Let's do that next.

```{r no-data-scale }

## No Data Values
# extract no data value from the attributes
noDataVal <- as.integer(reflInfo$`data ignore value`)

# set all reflectance values = 15,000 to NA
b56[b56 == noDataVal] <- NA


## Scales
# Extract the scale factor as an object
scaleFactor <- reflInfo$`Scale Factor`

# divide all values in our B56 object by the scale factor to get a range of
# reflectance values between 0-1 (the valid range)
b56 <- b56/scaleFactor

## Results
# view distribution of reflectance values
hist(b56,
		 col="skyblue",
     main="Distribution of Reflectance Values -- Band 56 \n With NoData Value & Non-scaled Data")

```

Note -- if we notice values > 1 (outside of the valid range) we may want to assign
those values to NA.


## Rotated Data

Let's look at the data from the site. 

<figure class="half">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/teakettle-crop-image.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/teakettle-crop-image.png"></a>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/view-data-2.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/view-data-2.png"></a>
    <figcaption>LEFT: Aerial photo of Lower Teakettle , RIGHT: Our plotted data. Notice a difference?</figcaption>
</figure>

R expects data to come in as a matrix or table with the format: row, column, 
other data. However, our data are arrnaged: column, row. Hence our image appears 
rotated in comparison to reality. We need to transpose x and y values in order 
for our final image to plot properly.

```{r transpose-data }

# transpose the data frame
b56 <- t(b56)

# replot
image(log(b56), 
			main="Band 56\nCorrect Orientation")

```

## Define Spatial Extent

Next, we need to create the spatial extent required to position the raster in 
space.

```{r read-map-info }
# We can extract the upper left-hand corner coordinates.
# the numbers as position 4 and 5 are the UPPER LEFT CORNER (x,y)
mapInfo<-unlist(strsplit(mapInfo, ","))

# grab the X,Y left corner coordinate
# ensure the format is numeric with as.numeric()
xMin <- as.numeric(mapInfo[4])
yMax <- as.numeric(mapInfo[5])

# we can get the x and y resolution from this string too
res <- c(mapInfo[6],mapInfo[7])
res <- as.numeric(res)

# finally calculate the xMax value and the yMin value from the dimensions 
# we grabbed above. The xMax is the left corner + number of columns* resolution.
xMax <- xMin + (dims[1]*res[1])
yMin <- yMax - (dims[2]*res[2])

# also note that x and y res are the same (1 meter)

# Now, define the raster extent
# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax)

# now we can create a raster and assign it it's spatial extent
b56r <- raster(b56,
               crs=CRS("+init=epsg:32611"))
# assign CRS
extent(b56r) <- rasExt

# view raster object attributes
b56r

# plot the new image 
plot(b56r, 
     main="Raster for Lower Teakettle \nBand 56")

```

## Export to GeoTIFF

Finally, we may want to export our new raster to a GeoTIFF format.

```{r export-tif, eval=FALSE}

writeRaster(b56r,  # object to write
            file="Outputs/TEAK/band56.tif",  # new file name/path
            format="GTiff",  # format to write it to
            naFlag=-9999)   # assign the naValues
```
