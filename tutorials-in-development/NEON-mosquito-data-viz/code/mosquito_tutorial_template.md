## Example YAML header
This does not appear on the rendered page, but is the first element of any .Rmd 
or .md file that will render.  
In .Rmd lastModified should be `lastModified: `r format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d")` `

{% include _toc.html %}

	Below the YAML header, the first code should be the include for a table of
	contents that appears in the right side bar "Overview": 
	
	 { % include _toc.html %}

## About
1-2 sentences describing what the lesson is about.  
This is an example post to document and explore available styles.  Each section
first has the text/style as it renders and then the text/style is repeated as a
code chunk to demonstrate how it is coded.

## Brief Text & Coding Style Guide 
All tutorials & files have a 80 character width limit.  Single space after a 
period is used throughout.  

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when used
in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*. 

	 The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when
	 used in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*. 

Functions described in the text are written at `function()` (e.g.,"We will use
`read_OGR()` to read in these data.") and directories are written
 `home/directory/`. 

In code chunks there should be a space between the chunk initial and end code 
and the text. All comments in coding chunks should have a space between the # and the text 

	 ```{r code-chunk}
	 
	 # add 1 +1
	 1+1
	 2
	 
	 ```

## Rule

create rule (pale grey horizontal line) using atlas 3 stars ( * )

	 to create a rule
	 ***

***

## Headers
All headers with in lessons are headers 2-4. There MUST be a space between the #
and the text for these to render properly with Jekyll 3.0. Headers 1 & 2  show up
in the table of contents side bar (default, can be changed in the _config file).  

## Heading two
	## Heading two

### Heading three
	### Heading three

## Data Tips/Data Notes

When there is "bonus" information it can be added as a Data Tip (coding related)
or Data Note (not coding related). Same look for both just the first words are
different. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Here is a block with a data tip. 
Sometimes it might have some `code` in it. A data tip can include a list or
links, however, it cannot contain figures, etc. 
{: .notice}

## Quote Blocks

> you can use all sorts of different spacing and bullets in it too
>
> * list one
> * list two
> but you have to use a `>` on each line for it to work which is a pain.

## Links & Additional Information
Any internal links (those to other locations within neondataskills.org) will 
open within the same tab.  External links should open in a new tab 
(target="_blank").

When adding additional information with links to the lessons they should be as a 
separate bullet point or bulleted list unless incorporated into the text.

## Challenges

All challenges are Header 2. The div tag (<\div>) goes BEFORE the code chunk 
associated with the challenge. 

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Title of Challenge
  
Here is some challenge text.

* it can have bullets
* another bullet

or 

1. a numbered list
2. or two 

some more text here

**bolding stuff**

*italicize stuff*

It can have multiple paragraphs too.
</div>

### Challenge Code Chunks

We can include the answers to challenge questions in the .Rmd files but not have
them appear. If we set `echo=FALSE`, then the code will render in the `R` script
(that can be downloaded at the bottom of each page) but will not render on the 
page itself. 

	``` {r challenge-code-name-here, echo=FALSE}
	# we don't want challenge code to post but do want it to appear 
	# in the .R script.
	```

If we want to hide the answer output add `results=hide`. If we want to
keep the figures and allow them to show use `include=TRUE`.

	```  {r challenge-code-name, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
	# If you want figures but no code or results to appear.
	```
