##About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the earth's surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands - up to hundreds of bands - that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.

The NEON imaging spectrometer (NIS) collects data within the 380 nm to 2510 nm portions of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5 nm in width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately 428 bands - which means BIG DATA.

</figure>
 
The HDF5 data model natively compresses data stored within it (makes it smaller) and supports data slicing (extracting only the portions of the data that you need to work with rather than reading the entire dataset into memory). These features in addition to the ability to support spatial data and associated metadata make it ideal for working with large data cubes such as those generated by imaging spectrometers.

##About This Activity
In this activity we will explore reading and extracting spatial raster data stored within a HDF5 file using `R`. Please be sure that you have *atleast* version 2.10 of `rhdf5` installed. Use: `packageVersion("rhdf5")` to check the package version. If you need to update `rhdf5`, use the following code:

	source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
	biocLite("rhdf5")

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** To update all packages installed in `R`, use `update.packages()`.
{: .notice}


##1. Read HDF5 data into R
We will use the `raster` and `rhdf5` packages to read in the HDF5 file that contains hyperspectral data for the <a href="http://neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/san-joaquin" target="_blank">NEON San Joaquin field site</a>. Let's start by calling the needed libraries and reading in our NEON HDF5 file.  
 
    #r Load `raster` and `rhdf5` packages and read NIS data into R
    library(raster)
    library(rhdf5)
	library(rgdal)
    #load our file 
    f <- '/path/to/your/data/SJER_140123_chip.h5'
    #look at the HDF5 file structure 
    h5ls(f,all=T)

When you look at the structure of the data, take note of the `map info dataset`, the `spatial info` group, and the `wavelengths` and `reflectance` datasets. The `spatial info` folder contains the spatial attributes of the data including its Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The CRS documents how the data are physically location on the earth. The `wavelengths` dataset contains the middle wavelength values for each band in the data. The reflectance dataset contains the image data that we will use for both data processing and visualization. 

More Information on raster metadata:

* [Metadata to understand when working with raster data](http://neondataskills.org/HDF5/Working-With-Rasters/ "Key Attributes of Raster Data")

* [Metadata and importa concepts associated with multi-band (multi and hyperspectral) rasters](http://neondataskills.org/HDF5/About-Hyperspectral-Remote-Sensing-Data/ "Key Attributes of Raster Data")

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip - HDF5 Structure:** Note that the structure of individual HDF5 files may vary depending on who produced the data. In this case, the Wavelength and reflectance data within the file are both datasets. However the spatial information is contained within a group. Data downloaded from another organization like NASA, may look different. This is why it's important to explore the data before diving into using it!
{: .notice}

We can use the `h5readAttributes` function to read and extract metadata from the HDF5 file. Let's start by reading in the spatial information.

 
    #r get spatial info and map info using the h5readAttributes function 
    #notes - this function was developed by the infamous Ted Hart.
	spinfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"spatialInfo")

Next, let's read in the wavelength center associated with each band in the HDF5 file. Which wavelength is band 19 associated with? (hint: look at the wavelengths vector that we just imported and check out the data located at index 19 - `wavelengths[19]`).

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/bluelight.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/bluelight.png"></a>
    <figcaption>472 nanometers falls within the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</figcaption>
</figure>

Band 19 has a associate wavelength center or 0.47244 which is in micrometers. This value equates to 472.44 nanometers (nm) which is in the visible blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~ 400-700 nm). 

    
    #get shape of the wavelength dataset (how many bands in the data?)
    #get the dimensions of the wavelengths dataset in the H5 file
    shapeWave<-dim(h5read(f,"wavelength"))
    #read in the wavelength information from the Hdf5 file
    wavelengths<- h5read(f,"wavelength",index=list(1:shapeWave[1],shapeWave[2]))

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Bands and Wavelengths** A *band* represents a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values between 800nm and 805nm might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. The imaging spectrometer collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light in that band. Often when you work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the band information is reported as the center wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the wavelengths represented in that  band. Thus in a band spanning 800-805 nm, the center would be 802.5 nm). The full width half max (FWHM) will also be reported. This value represents the spread of the band around that center point. So, a band that covers 800 nm-805 nm might have a FWHM of 2.5 and a wavelength value of 802.5.

    <figcaption>Bands represent a range of values (types of light) within the electromagnetic spectrum. Values for each band are often represented as the center point value of each band.</figcaption>
</figure>

The HDF5 dataset that we are working with in this activity contains more information than we need to work with. For example, we don't necessarily need to process all 426 bands - if we are interested in creating a product like NDVI which only users bands in the near infra-red and red portions of the spectrum. Or we might only be interested in a spatial subset of the data - perhaps a region where we have plots in the field.

The HDF5 format allows us to slice (or subset) the data - quickly extracting the subset that we need to process. Let's extract one of the green bands in our dataset - band 34. By the way - what is the center wavelength value associated with band 34? hint `wavelengths[34]`. How do we know this band is a green band in the visible portion of the spectrum?

    
    #get the dimensions of the reflectance dataset in the H5 file
    shapeRefl<-dim(h5read(f,"Reflectance"))
    #Extract or "slice" data for band 34 from the HDF5 file
    b34<- h5read(f,"Reflectance",index=list(1:shapeRefl[1],1:shapeRefl[2],34))
	

###A Note About Data Slicing in HDF5
Data slicing allows us to extract and work with subsets of the data rather than reading in the entire dataset into memory. Thus, in this case, we can extract and plot the green band without reading in all 426 bands of information. The ability to slice large datasets, makes HDF5 ideal for working with big data. 	


Next, let's convert our data from an array (more than 2 dimensions) to a matrix (just 2 dimensions). We need to have our data in a matrix format to plot it.

    #Convert from array to matrix
    b34 <- b34[,,1]
    

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Arrays vs. Matrices** Arrays are matrices with more than 2 dimensions. When we say dimension, we are talking about the "z" associated with the data (imagine a series of tabs in a spreadsheet). Put the other way: matrices are arrays with only 2 dimensions. Arrays can have any number of dimensions one, two, ten or more. 
{: .notice} 

Here is a matrix that is 4 x 3 in size (4 rows and 3 columns):

| Metric    | species 1 | species 2 |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| total number   | 23        | 45        |
| average weight | 14        | 5         |
| average length | 2.4       | 3.5       |
| average height | 32        | 12        |

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Dimensions in Arrays** An array contains 1 or more dimensions in the "z" direction. For example, let's say that we collected this same set of species data for every day in a 30 day month. We might then have a matrix like the one above for each day for a total of 30 days making a 4 x 3 x 30 array (this dataset has more than 2 dimensions).

Next, let's look at the metadata for the reflectance data. When we do this, take note of 1) the scale factor and 2) the data ignore value.
    
    # look at the metadata for the reflectance dataset
    h5readAttributes(f,"Reflectance")
    

Let's plot the band 34 data. Plotting spatial data as a visual "data check" is a good idea to make sure processing is being performed correctly and all is well with the image. 

    image(log(b34))
    #note - when R brings in the matrix, the dimensions are read in reverse order
    

What do you notice about the image? It's a bit dark and lacking any detail. What could be causing this? Let's look at the distribution of reflectance values in our data to figure out what is going on.

    #Plot range of reflectance values as a histogram to view range
    #and distribution of values.
    hist(b34,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta")
    #View values between 0 and 5000
    hist(b34,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(0, 5000))
    hist(b34, breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(5000, 15000),ylim=c(0,100))
    

As you're examining the histograms above, keep in mind that reflectance values range between 0-1. The **data scale factor** in the metadata tells us to divide all reflectance values by 10,000. Thus, a value of 5,000 equates to a reflectance value of 0.50. Storing data as integers (without decimal places) compared to floating points (with decimal places) creates a smaller file. You will see this done often when working with remote sensing data.  

Notice in the data that there are some larger reflectance values (>5,000) that represent a smaller number of pixels. These pixels are skewing how the image renders.   
   
Remember that the metadata for the `Reflectance` dataset designated 15,000 as `data ignore value`. Thus, let's set all pixels with a value > 14,999 to `NA` (no value). If we do this, R won't try to render these pixels.
	
	b34[b34 = 15000] <- NA

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Data Ignore Value** Image data in raster format will often contain a data ignore value and a scale factor. The data ignore value represents pixels where there are no data. Among other causes, no data values may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the image or to processing results which yield null values. 
{: .notice}

Our image still looks dark because R is trying to render all reflectance values between 0 and 14999 as if they were distributed equally in the histogram. However we know they are not distributed equally. There are many more values between 0-5000 then there are values >5000. The proper way to adjust our data would be what's called an `image stretch`. We will learn how to stretch our image data, later. For now, let's run a log on the pixel reflectance values to factor out those larger values. 

	image(log(b34))
	

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Reflectance Values and Image Stretch** Images have a distribution of reflectance values. A typical image viewing program will render the values by distributing the entire range of reflectance values  across a range of "shades" that the monitor can render - between 0 and 255. However, often the distribution of reflectance values is not linear. For example, in the case of ur data, most of the reflectance values fall between 0 and 0.5. Yet there are a few values >1 that are heavily impacting the way the image is drawn on our monitor. Imaging processing programs like ENVI, QGIS and ArcGIS (and even Adobe Photoshop) allow you to adjust the stretch of the image. This is similar to adjusting the contrast and brightness in Photoshop. Read more about this topic: <a href="http://www.r-s-c-c.org/node/241" target="_blank">About Image Stretch - RSCC</a> and another link that discusses image stretch <a href="http://www.r-s-c-c.org/node/240" target="_blank">Read more about linear image stretch discussion</a>
{: .notice}


The log applied to our image increases the contrast making it look more like an image. However, look at the images below. The top one is what our log adjusted image looks like when plotted. The bottom on is an RGB version of the same image. Notice a difference?

    <figcaption>LEFT: the image as it should look. RIGHT: the image that we outputted from the code above. Notice a difference?</figcaption>
</figure>
    
	#We need to transpose x and y values in order for our final image to plot properly
	b34<-t(b34)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip: Transpose** in HDF5 view, notice that there are three data dimensions for this file: Bands x Rows x Columns. However, when R reads in the dataset, it reads them as: Columns x Bands x Rows. The data are flipped. We can quickly transpose the data to correct for this using the `t` or `transpose` command in `R`.
{: .notice} 


The orientation is rotated in our log adjusted image. This is because `R` reads in matrices starting from the upper left hand corner. Whereas, most rasters read pixels starting from the lower left hand corner. In the next section, we will deal with this issue by creating a proper georeferenced (spatiall located) raster in R. The raster format will read in pixels following the same methods as other GIS and imaging processing software like QGIS and ENVI do.


##2. Create a Georeferenced Raster
Next, we will create a proper raster using the `b34` matrix. The raster format will allow us to define and manage:

* Image stretch
* Coordinate reference system / spatial reference
* Resolution

It will also account for the orientation issue discussed above.
 
To create a raster in R, we need a few pieces of information, including: 

* The coordinate reference system (CRS)
* The location of the first pixel (located in the lower left hand corner of the raster). 
* The resolution or size of each pixel in the data. 

First let's grab the spatial information that we need from the HDF5 file. The CRS and associated information that is needed is stored in the `map info` dataset. The map info string looks something like this: `"UTM,1.000,1.000,256521.000,4112571.000,1.000000e+000,`
`1.000000e+000,11,North,WGS-84,units=Meters" `. Notice that this information is separated by commas. We can use the `strsplit` command in R to extract each element into a vector. The elements are position 4 and 5 represent the lower left hand corner of the raster. We need this information to define the raster's extent.

	#Populate the raster image extent value. 
	#get the map info, split out elements
	mapInfo<-h5read(f,"map info")
	#Extract each element of the map info information 
	#so we can extract the lower left hand corner coordinates.
	mapInfo<-unlist(strsplit(mapInfo, ","))

Next we define the extents of our raster. The extents will be used to calculate the raster's resolution. The lower left hand corner is located at mapInfo[4:5]. We can define the final raster dataset extent by adding the number of rows to the Y lower left hand corner coordinate and the number of columns in the `Reflectance` dataset to the X lower left hand corner coordinate.

</figure>

[Learn more about raster attributes including extent, and coordinate reference systems here.](http://neondataskills.org/HDF5/Working-With-Rasters/) 

	#define extents of the data using metadata and matrix attributes
	xMN=as.numeric(mapInfo[4])
	xMX=(xMN+(ncol(b34)))
	yMX=as.numeric(mapInfo[5]) 
	yMN=(yMN-(nrow(b34)))     
	rasExt <- extent(xMN,xMX,yMN,yMX)

	#define final raster with projection info 
	#note that capitalization will throw errors on a MAC.
	#if UTM is all caps it might cause an error!
	b34r<-raster(b34, 
            crs=(spinfo$projdef))

	#assign the spatial extent to the raster
	extent(b34r) <- rasExt
	#look at raster attributes
	b34r

We've now created a raster from band 34 reflectance data. We can plot that data if we want using the `plot` command. 

	writeRaster(b34r,file="band34.tif",overwrite=TRUE)
	#we're done with the H5 file - 
    #close the H5 file
    H5close()
	
###Extra Credit
If you get done early, experiment with 

1. Creating rasters from other bands in the dataset.
2. Varying the distribution of values in the image to mimic an image stretch. e.g. `b34[b34 > 6000 ] <- 1`
