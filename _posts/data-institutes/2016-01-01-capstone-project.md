## About

The goals of the NEON Data Institute are to:

1. Provide hands-on experience with and knowledge needed to work with NEON remote
sensing data. and,
2. Provide an overview to efficient, reproducible science workflows.

## About The Capstone Project

As a capstone for this Institute, you will break up into small groups, to work 
on addressing a science question using NEON and other data.

Important: As you think about this project, consider what may be feasible to 
explore in a short (~1 days worth) amount of time. You may consider a small 
pilot project that could potentially be expanded, after you leave the Institute.  


## The Data
You are welcome to use any data you choose for this project. Combining NEON data
with external data is highly encouraged. You can learn more about what NEON 
data are currently available on our website:

## Document Your Work

 As you work on this project, please be sure to think about efficient workflows.
 This includes:

 * Organize your project data, code and outputs.
 * Write your code in a shareable format (RMarkdown or Jupyter Notebooks) you can 
clearly document the steps.

You will submit the code used to work with and process your data, via Github.
Please consider:

1. The organization of your working directory
2. The structure, organization and documentation of your code.

We encourage you to do all of your work in RMarkdown or Jupyter Notebook files!

## Project Presentation

 You will present your project to the group on Saturday.

***

## Thursday Afternoon - Get started

On Thursday of the Institute, we will spend some time discussing projects and you
will have time to figure out who you'd like to work with. Note: It is OK if you
would rather work independently, however a goal of this Institute is to practice
efficient collaboration skills, so we encourage you to work in groups!

Let's get started:

1. Figure out your group.
2. Figure out what data you will need and how much time you will need/have.
3. Run your idea past one of the Data Institute faculty. 
4. Get to work!
