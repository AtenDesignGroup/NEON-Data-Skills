###A NEON #WorkWithData Event
##About the NEON / Data Carpentry Hackathon 


The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is hosting a 3-day lesson-building hackathon to develop a suite of NEON/ Data Carpentry data tutorials. The tutorials will be used to teach fundamental big data skills needed to work efficiently with large spatio-temporal data using open tools. Data lessons were initially developed in R.
