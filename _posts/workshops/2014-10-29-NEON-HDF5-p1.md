#A Hands-on Primer for Working with Big Data in R: Introduction to Common Formats & Efficient Data Visualization

##A NEON Data Carpentry Workshop


This workshop will providing hands on experience with working hierarchical data formats(HDF5), and lidar data in R. It will also cover spatial data analysis in R.

##Setup
To participate in the workshop, you will need working copies of the software described below. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download the installers) before the start of the workshop.

#HDFView

Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) is a file format used to store, package, and simultaneously organize large quantities of related data. Although we will use R to analyze data stored in this format, HDFView is free-ware that allows for quick and easy viewing and editing of these files.

#R

R is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with R, we recommend, but do not require, RStudio, an interactive development environment (IDE). We will use several packages, including rhdf5 and gdal. DOWNLOAD (1) the package installation script here, (2) the gdal libraries, and (3) the hdf5 libraries.

#Optional resources

##QGIS

QGIS is a cross-platform Open Source Geographic Information system.

##Online LiDAR Data Viewer (las viewer)

[http://plas.io](http://plas.io) is a Open Source LiDAR data viewer developed by Martin Isenberg of Las Tools and several of his colleagues.
