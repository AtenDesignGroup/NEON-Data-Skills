## Welcome to Day Two of the Institute!

In the morning, we will focus on data workflows, organization and automation as 
a means to write more efficient, usable code.

Later, we will review the basics of discrete return and full waveform lidar data.
We will then work with some NEON lidar derived raster data products.

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Explain the difference between active and passive sensors.
* Explain the difference between discrete return and full waveform LiDAR.
* Describe applications of LiDAR remote sensing data in the natural sciences. 
* Describe several NEON LiDAR remote sensing data products.
* Explain why modularization is important and supports efficient coding practices.
* How to modularize code using functions.
* Integrate basic automation into your existing data workflow.
