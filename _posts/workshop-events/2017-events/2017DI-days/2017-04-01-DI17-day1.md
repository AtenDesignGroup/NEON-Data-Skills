## Additional Information 

We will be touring the NEON facilities on Monday including several labs. Please
wear long pants and close-toed shoes to conform to lab safety standards. 

Many individuals find the temperature of the classroom where the Data Institute 
is held to be cooler than they prefer.  We recommend you bring a sweater or light
jacket with you. 

You will have the opportunity to eat your lunch on an outdoor patio - hats or 
sunglasses may be appreciated.
