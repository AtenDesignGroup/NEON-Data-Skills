## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 2

The goal of the pre-institute materials is to ensure that everyone comes to the
Institute ready to work in a collaborative research environment. If you recall,
from last week, the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reproducible-research/rep-sci-intro" target="_blank">four facets of reproducibility</a> include:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation
* Dissemination

This week we will focus on Git and GitHub. The Git environment supports both a
collaborative approach to science through code sharing and dissemination,
and a powerful version control system that supports both efficient project
organization, and an effective way to save your work.

## Week 2 Materials
Please complete each of the short tutorials in this series: 

* <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/git-github/"> Version Control with GitHub</a>

*If you are familiar with forked repos and pull requests in GitHub, and the use 
of Git in the command line, you may be able to complete the assignment without 
viewing the tutorials.*

## Week 2 Assignment

The assignment for this week is to revise the Data Institute capstone project
summary that you developed last week. You will submit your project summary, with
a brief biography to introduce yourself, to a shared 
<a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
