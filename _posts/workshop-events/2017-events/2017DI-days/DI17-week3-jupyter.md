## Welcome to pre-Institute Week 3

In week 3, you will use the Jupyter Notebook file format to document code and efficiently
publish code results & outputs. You will practice your Git skills by publishing
your work in the **NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants** GitHub repository.

Please complete the activity and submit your work to the GitHub repo by
**11:59 Thursday June 16th.**

## Week 3 Materials
Please complete each of the short tutorials in this series:

**NOTE:** If you are familiar with using R Markdown files to document your
workflow and knitting to HTML then you may be able to complete the assignment
without viewing the tutorials.

throughout the week. You will also have access to all NEON remote sensing data
