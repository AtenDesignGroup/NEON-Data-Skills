{% include _toc.html %}

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides open ecological data 
from over 80 locations across the United States. These data are available both 
on the NEON data portal and through the NEON Application Programming Interface 
(API). The API allows direct programmatic access to data and metadata in the 
NEON database, enabling automation and instantaneous updating of code and models. 
Come to this workshop to learn to navigate the NEON API. NEON scientists will 
demonstrate how to use the API, focusing on access via the R package `httr`, but 
also covering the general API structure. Attendees are encouraged to bring 
laptops and code along with the demonstration. 

### Required Prior Knowledge

Basic familiarity with R is recommended; no previous experience with APIs 
needed. The demonstration materials will also be made available online. 

***

This 1.5-hr workshop will be taught at the 2017 meeting of the Ecological
Society of America (ESA) in Portland, OR. You must be a registered 
attendee of the conference **and register for this workshop with your ESA 
registration** to participate in this workshop. For more information, visit the 
<a href="http://www.esa.org/portland/" target="_blank">ESA 2017 annual meeting website</a>.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need For The Workshop

To fully participant in this workshop, we recommend you bring a **laptop** with 
the most current version of R loaded on your computer. You can still participate
in the workshop without bringing a laptop. 

For details on setting up R & RStudio in Mac, PC, or Linux operating systems, 
please see [the instructions below]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop-event/ESA2016-raster-time-workshop#additional-set-up-resources).

### Install R Packages

Please have these packages *installed* and *updated* **prior** to the start of 
the workshop.

* **httr:** `install.packages("httr")`

#### Updating R Packages

In RStudio, you can go to `Tools --> Check for package updates` to update 
previously installed packages on your computer.

Or you can use `update.packages()` to update all packages that are 
installed in R automatically.
