NEON's Data Institutes provide critical skills and foundational knowledge for 
graduate students and early career scientists working with heterogeneous 
spatio-temporal data to address ecological questions. 

## June 2017: Remote Sensing with Reproducible Workflows
Our 2017 Institute focused on remote sensing of vegetation using open source 
tools and reproducible science workflows -- the primary **programming language will 
be Python**. This Institute will be held at NEON headquarters in June 2017.

### Online Resources
The teaching materials from the 2017 Data Institute will be available as 
self-paced online tutorials after the Institute. In the meantime, you can access 
the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/workshop-event/NEON-Work-With-Data-Insitute-2016" target="_blank">2016 Data Institute materials here</a>.
These 2016 materials were designed to be used in the context of the workshop with an 
instructor. In 2016, the primary **programming language was R**.
