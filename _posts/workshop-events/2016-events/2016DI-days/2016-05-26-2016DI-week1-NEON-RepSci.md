## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 1

In the first week of the pre-institute activities, we will review the NEON
project. We will also provide you with a general overview of reproducible science.
Over the next few weeks will we ask you to review materials and submit something
that demonstrates you have mastered the materials.

## Week 1 Activity
After reviewing the materials below, please write up a
summary of a project that you are interested working on at the Data Institute.
Be sure to consider what data you will need (NEON or
other). You will have time to refine your idea over the next few weeks.
Save this document as you will submit it next week as a part of week 2 materials!
