## About

On Thursday, we will begin to think about the different types of analysis
that we can do by fusing LiDAR and hyperspectral data products.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Describe a thresholding approach to data fusion that masks and identifies 
areas of a site with similar physical and other characteristics 
(e.g. the same slope, aspect, elevation, vegetation height)
* Describe a statistical approach to data fusion
