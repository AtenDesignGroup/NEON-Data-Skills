NEON's Data Institutes provide critical skills and foundational knowledge for 
graduate students and early career scientists working with heterogeneous 
spatio-temporal data to address ecological questions. 

## June 2016: Remote Sensing with Reproducible Workflows
Our 2016 Institute focused on remote sensing of vegetation using open source 
tools and reproducible science workflows. The programming language of instruction
in 2016 was **R**. This Institute was held at NEON headquarters in June 2016.

### Online Resources
The teaching materials from the 2016 Data Institute will be converted into 
self-paced online tutorial series and will be provided free on this site. In the
meantime, you can directly access the 
<a href="http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/" target="_blank">2016 Data Institute materials here</a>.
These materials were designed to be used in the context of the workshop with an instructor.
