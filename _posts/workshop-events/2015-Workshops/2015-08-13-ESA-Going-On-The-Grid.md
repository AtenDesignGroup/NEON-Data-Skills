description: "This brown-bag style workshop, at ESA 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland, 
provided an overview of the basic knowledge needed to begin to exploring 
converting point data into raster or gridding format. Most of the demonstrations 
were performed in ArcGIS, however, concepts learned can be applied to any tool 
that supports spatial interpolation functions."

Scientists often need to create continuous datasets, in raster or gridded format, 
of biomass, carbon, vegetation height and other metrics from points sampled on the 
landscape. However, when converting points to pixels, there are many processing 
choices that can impact the uncertainty of derived raster datasets. Incomplete 
understanding of the uncertainty in derived products, in turn, impacts downstream 
analytical and model results and can lead to erroneous conclusions drawn from the 
data. This lunchtime brown-bag workshop will explore how different gridding methods
and associated settings  can impact rasters derived from sample points. We will use 
a LiDAR point cloud, which represents canopy height values, to 
create several raster grids 
using different point-to-pixel conversion methods. We will then quantify and 
assess differences in height values derived using these different methods.

Participants will leave the workshop with a better understanding of various 
point-to-pixel conversion methods (interpolators and other gridding methods), how
 to interpret the resulting pixel values, how to perform basic raster math, and 
some of the key questions we should ask ourselves before creating a seamless grid 
from a point-based dataset. ArcGIS will be the primary demonstration tool used 
in this workshop however all concepts can be applied using any program with gridding 
capabilities.
