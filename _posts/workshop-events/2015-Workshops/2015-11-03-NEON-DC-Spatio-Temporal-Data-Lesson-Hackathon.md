**A NEON #WorkWithData Event**

## The NEON & Data Carpentry Hackathon 


The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) hosted a 3-day 
lesson building hackathon to develop a suite of NEON and Data Carpentry data 
tutorials. The tutorials will be used to teach fundamental big data skills 
needed to work efficiently with large spatio-temporal data using open tools. 
Data lessons were initially developed in R.

## Hackathon Results

This hackathon resulted in four lesson series that are used for workshops provided
by NEON and by Data Carpentry. The lessons are hosted on both the NEON Data Skills
site and the Data Carpentry site. .

The hackathon also resulted in several lesson outlines that have not yet been 
completed. These are in rough draft form and contributions are welcomed.
