Ecologists working across scales and integrating disparate datasets face new 
challenges to data management and analysis that demand toolkits that go above 
and beyond the spreadsheet. This workshop will offer ecologists an overview of 
the variety of data formats and types that are typically encountered when 
working with ‘Big Data’, and an introduction to available tools in R for working 
with these formats. The first half of the workshop will introduce participants 
to these formats, including ASCII, NetCDF4, HDF5, and las. Participants will 
then learn to (1) access and visualize large datasets in these formats using R, 
and (2) to use metadata to efficiently integrate datasets from multiple 
ecological data sources for analysis. In the second half of the workshop, we 
will apply the knowledge from the first half to work through a practical 
example of how to integrate field-collected vegetation structure data with 
remotely sensed LiDAR data. For this example, we will use data collected by 
the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a continental-scale, 
NSF-funded effort to collect and freely serve terabytes of data per year 
(stored in a diversity of formats) over the next 30 years to enable ecological 
research. Participants will therefore leave the workshop with a basic 
understanding of the data that NEON and other large projects offer and some 
basic tools that support the use of Big Data to enhance their own research.
