###Getting Started
To be able to access HDF5 files, you'll need to first install the base [HDF5 libraries](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html#obtain). It might also be useful to install [HDFview](http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/) which will allow you to explore the contents of an HDF5 file visually using a graphic interface. 

The package we'll be using is `rhdf5` which is part of the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) suite of `R` packages. If you haven't installed this package before, you can use the first two lines of code below to install. Then use the library command to call the `rhdf5` library.

	#source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
	#biocLite("rhdf5")
	library("rhdf5")

###HDF5 Quick Review
The HDF5 format is a self-contained directory structure. In HDF5 files though "directories" are called "**groups**" and "**files**" are called "datasets". Each element in an hdf5 file can have metadata attached to it making HDF5 files "self-describing".

##Temperature Time Series - Working with Temporal NEON Tower Data  
In this activity, we'll work with a real world data file. We will work with  [flux tower temperature data](http://neoninc.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements) collected by the [NEON project](http://www.neoninc.org). NEON will provide 30 years of free ecological data.

In this case, we'll examine this file as if we knew nothing about it. We will view it's structure, extract metadata and visualize the contents of the files. The goal of the lesson is to use loops and custom functions to quickly examine data with a complex nested structure using advanced tools like `dplyr`.

###P1. Examine file contents

Often we won't know the structure of an HDF5 file that we receive. In this case, we'll need to start by explore the underlying structure. Let's load up a NEON flux tower data file and examine its contents using `h5ls`.

	#r load file
	#NOTE: be sure to adjust the path to match your file structure!
	f <- "data/NEON_TowerDataD3_D10.hdf5"
	h5ls(f,all=T)

Note that `h5ls` returns the full, hierarchical file structure including the group name, the name of a particular node (which may be a group), the type, class and the dimensions of the object.  In this case the class of the groups is compound. Compound class means there are mixed data types contained within that group. The dimensions are returned as the number of elements for compound groups.

One major benefit of HDF5 files is the ability to subset and slice out parts of the file. Let's extract some temperature data, collected at the Ordway Swisher Biological Station, <a href="http://neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/ordway-swisher-biological-station" target="_blank">A NEON Field Site</a> and plot it.

Now remember, we are dealing with **hierarchical data**. In this case we have a nested group and dataset structure. Below, we will extract temperature data which is located within the following structure:
 Domain_03 --> Ord --> min_1 --> boom_1 -->temperature
 
Take note that there are 4 groups and one dataset called temperature in this part of the hdf5 file.

	#read in temperature data
	temp <- h5read(f,"/Domain_03/Ord/min_1/boom_1/temperature")
	#view the first few lines of the data 
	head(temp)
	plot(temp$mean,type='l')

We can make our plot look a bit nicer by adding date values to the x axis.

	#let's fix up the plot above a bit. We can first add dates to the x axis. 
	#in order to list dates, we need to specify the format that the date field is in.
	temp$date <- as.POSIXct(temp$date ,format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "EST")
	
	ordwayPlot <- qplot (date,mean,data=temp,geom="line", title="ordwayData",
	                 main="Mean Temperature - Ordway Swisher", xlab="Date", 
	                 ylab="Mean Temperature (Degrees C)")
	
	#let's check out the plot
	ordwayPlot

Your plot should look like this - pretty cool, right?:

### Extracting metadata
Another advantage of HDF5 is that it's self describing. This means that metadata are embedded in the file. Metadata can be associated with every group, dataset and even the file itself. 

To read the metadata for elements in a file, you can use the `h5readAttributes` function. We'll work with this next.

	## Get names of elements in our file
	fiu_struct <- h5ls(f,all=T)
	## Concatenate the second element.
	g <- paste(fiu_struct[2,1:2],collapse="/")
	## Check out what that element is
	print(g)
	## Now view the metadata
	h5readAttributes(f,g)

##P2 Visualizing datasets in a HDF5 File

This particular dataset contains temperature data collected using different sensors across for multiple field sites and through time. What is we wanted to create a plot that compared data across sensors or sites? 

##P2a. Data from different sensors at one site

To compare data, we'll first need to loop through the HDF5 file and build a new data frame that contains temperature information over time, for each sensor or site. Let's start by comparing temperature data collected by sensor located at different heights (on different boom arms on the tower), and averaged every 1 minute for the NEON Domain 3 site, Ordway Swisher Biological Station located in Florida.

	# Load libraries
	library(dplyr)
	library(ggplot2)
	# Set the path string
	s <- "/Domain_03/Ord/min_1"

    # Grab the paths to the data we want to use
	paths <- fiu_struct %>% filter(grepl(s,group), grepl("DATA",otype)) %>% group_by(group) %>% summarise(path = paste(group,name,sep="/"))
ord_temp <- data.frame()
	

The above code uses the powerful `dplyr` libraries to filter data. Let's break the code down. 

- `fiu_struct`, defined above in the code, is the structure of our HDF5 file that we returned using `h5ls`.
- `grepl` looks for a text pattern. Type `help(grepl)` to see how it operates. We want to return all "paths" in the HDF file that match `s` which we defined earlier as "/Domain_03/Ord/min_1". Type `s` into the console to see what comes up. 

Pulling this together, type, `fiu_struct %>% filter(grepl(s,group))` in the console. This code will return a list of both datasets and groups for the Domain_03 site that contain the "/Domain_03/Ord/min_1" path. 
Now let's review the second part of the code:

- `grepl("DATA",otype))` tells R to look for objects in the file that contain the word "data". Type: `fiu_struct %>% filter(grepl(s,group), grepl("DATA",otype))` in the console. Notice that this code returns the elements in the file that are both for the Ordway site AND are of type "dataset".
- `group_by(group) %>% summarise(path = paste(group,name,sep="/"))`: This code appends the group name (boom_1, boom_2, etc.) and the dataset name (temperature in this case) to the path.

Next, we will create a loop that will populate the final data.frame that contains information for all booms in the site that we want to plot.
     
    for(i in paths$path){
     boom <-  strsplit(i,"/")[[1]][5]
     dat <- h5read(f,i)
     dat$boom <- rep(boom,dim(dat)[1])
     ord_temp <- rbind(ord_temp,dat)
    }

The loop above iterates through the file and grabs the temperature data for each boom in the 1 minute data series for Ordway. It also adds the boom name to the end of the `data.frame` as follows: 

- `for i in path$path`. We have 5 "paths" total - one for each boom: booms 1,2,3,5 and the tower top (boom 4 doesn't have a temperature sensor on it). Thus we will need do iterate through the data 5 times
- `boom <-  strsplit(i,"/")[[1]][5]`: identify the name of the boom for iteration i. 
- `dat <- h5read(f,i)`: read in the data from our hdf5 file (f) for iteration i (whichever iteration in the loop we are on) .
-  `dat$boom <- rep(boom,dim(dat)[1])`: add the boom name as the final column in the dataset - column named "boom"
-  `ord_temp <- rbind(ord_temp,dat)`: append dataset to the end of the data.frame called ord_temp

    EXTRA CREDIT: Modify the loop above so that it added both the boom name, the site name and the data type (1 minute) as columns in our data frame.

### Cleaning Up Dates
As imported, the dates field in our data frame aren't in "date format". we need to tell R to format the information as a date. This will ensure that the plot that we create has dates labeled correctly. Let's dig in:

	ord_temp$date <- as.POSIXct(ord_temp$date,format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "EST")

Now we can make our plot of temperature for all booms on the tower!

	ggplot(ord_temp,aes(x=date,y=mean,group=boom,colour=boom))+geom_path()+ylab("Mean temperature") + xlab("Date")+theme_bw()+ggtitle("3 Days of temperature data at Ordway Swisher")

##P2b. Data from different sites

Now, what if we want to compare temperatures at our two different sites? Well let's do that but this time we'll compare 30 minute averages. We'll need to modify our search strings a bit. Bbut we can still re-use most of the code we just built.

First, let's extract all 30 minute averaged data, for all sites.

	s <- "min_30"
	# Grab the paths for all sites, 30 minute averaged data
	paths <- fiu_struct %.% filter(grepl(s,group), grepl("DATA",otype)) %.% group_by(group) %.% summarise(path = paste(group,name,sep="/"))

	temp_30 <- data.frame()
	for(i in paths$path){
	  boom <-  strsplit(i,"/")[[1]][5]
	  site <- strsplit(i,"/")[[1]][3]
	  dat <- h5read(f,i)
	  dat$boom <- rep(boom,dim(dat)[1])
	  dat$site <- rep(site,dim(dat)[1])
	 temp_30 <- rbind(temp_30,dat)
	}

	#Assign the date field to a "date" format in R
	temp_30$date <- as.POSIXct(temp_30$date,format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

	temp30_sum <- temp_30 %.% group_by(date,site) %.% summarise(mean = mean(mean))
	
	#Create plot!
	ggplot(temp30_sum,aes(x=date,y=mean,group=site,colour=site)) + geom_path()+ylab("Mean temperature") + xlab("Date")+theme_bw()+ggtitle("Comparison of Ordway-Swisher(FL) vs Sterling(CO)")

> Extra Credit: Create a plot of both sites with all booms at each site on the plot.
