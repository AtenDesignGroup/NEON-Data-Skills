Did you ever wonder how your camera actually takes a picture? It's all about 
light - it records the light that objects reflect. This video explores the basic 
principles used by optical sensors like Landsat, AVIRIS, and other remote sensing 
sensors to record the things that we can't see with our eyes - like the health of 
plants on the ground. It explains the basic principles of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, bands and spectral resolution in data and the uses of spectral data 
to answer science questions.
