Data can help us understand the causes and effects of natural disturbance events. 
This video delves into the data that allow us to better understand the September 
2013 flooding events along the Front Range of Colorado.  We track the storm 
through satellite imagery, rainfall and stream gauge data and then look at the 
consequences of the storm through LiDAR measurements and satellite imagery. The 
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project will collect data like 
this for over 30 years to help monitor changes in our environment.
