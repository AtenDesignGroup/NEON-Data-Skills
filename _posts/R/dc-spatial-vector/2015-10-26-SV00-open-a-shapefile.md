## About
In this tutorial, we will open and plot point, line and polygon vector data 
stored in shapefile format in `R`.

**R Skill Level:** Introduction - you are just getting started with spatial data
in `R`, but have some of the other `R` basics down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Goals / Objectives
After completing this activity, you will:

 * Know the difference between point, line, and polygon vector elements.
 * Understand the differences between opening point, line and polygon shapefiles
    in `R`.
 * Understand the components of a spatial object in `R`.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

You will need the most current version of `R` and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded 
on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **sp:** `install.packages("sp")`

## About Vector Data
Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x,y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization 
of the vertices, determines the type of vector that we are working 
with: point, line or polygon.

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or 
    polygons. Each object type has a different structure.

</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream 
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and 
"closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or 
countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a
hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but
not an issue we will deal with in this tutorial.

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as 
 states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these
 boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".
{: .notice}

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format. 
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of 
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `rgdal` package to work with vector data in `R`. Notice that the
`sp` package automatically loads when `rgdal` is loaded. We will also load the
`raster` package so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.


    # load required libraries
    # for vector work; sp package will load with rgdal.
    library(rgdal)  
    # for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
    library(raster) 
    
    # set working directory to the directory location on your computer where
    # you downloaded and unzipped the data files for the tutorial
    # setwd("pathToDirHere")

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary, 
* A line shapefile representing roads, and 
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher   
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a> 
located at the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import 
shapefiles we use the `R` function `readOGR()`.

`readOGR()` requires two components:

1. The directory where our shapefile lives: `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV`
2. The name of the shapefile (without the extension): `HarClip_UTMZ18`

Let's import our AOI.


    # Import a polygon shapefile: readOGR("path","fileName")
    # no extension needed as readOGR only imports shapefiles
    aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV",
                                "HarClip_UTMZ18")

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV", layer: "HarClip_UTMZ18"
    ## with 1 features
    ## It has 1 fields

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The acronym, OGR, refers to the
OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation.

{: .notice}  

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into `R` (as our
`aoiBoundary_HARV` object), the `readOGR()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object. 

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The 
 [Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/) 
tutorial provides more information on both metadata and attributes
and using attributes to subset and plot data. 
{: .notice}

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object. 
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of 
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the 
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `class`, `crs` and `extent` methods:


    # view just the class for the shapefile
    class(aoiBoundary_HARV)

    ## [1] "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"
    ## attr(,"package")
    ## [1] "sp"

    # view just the crs for the shapefile
    crs(aoiBoundary_HARV)

    ## CRS arguments:
    ##  +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
    ## +towgs84=0,0,0

    # view just the extent for the shapefile
    extent(aoiBoundary_HARV)

    ## class       : Extent 
    ## xmin        : 732128 
    ## xmax        : 732251.1 
    ## ymin        : 4713209 
    ## ymax        : 4713359

    # view all metadata at same time
    aoiBoundary_HARV

    ## class       : SpatialPolygonsDataFrame 
    ## features    : 1 
    ## extent      : 732128, 732251.1, 4713209, 4713359  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
    ## coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
    ## variables   : 1
    ## names       : id 
    ## min values  :  1 
    ## max values  :  1

Our `aoiBoundary_HARV` object is a polygon of class `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, 
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object 
`extent` values as it specifies units.

    the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and 
    west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row" 
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types 
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of 
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.

    </figcaption>
</figure>


We view the attributes of a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` using `objectName@data`
(e.g., `aoiBoundary_HARV@data`). 


    # alternate way to view attributes 
    aoiBoundary_HARV@data

    ##   id
    ## 0  1

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering 
the name of the `R` object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **class**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the `R` object. The last two lines of
`summary` show a preview of the `R` object **attributes**.


    # view a summary of metadata & attributes associated with the spatial object
    summary(aoiBoundary_HARV)

    ## Object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
    ## Coordinates:
    ##       min       max
    ## x  732128  732251.1
    ## y 4713209 4713359.2
    ## Is projected: TRUE 
    ## proj4string :
    ## [+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
    ## +towgs84=0,0,0]
    ## Data attributes:
    ##        id   
    ##  Min.   :1  
    ##  1st Qu.:1  
    ##  Median :1  
    ##  Mean   :1  
    ##  3rd Qu.:1  
    ##  Max.   :1


# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our `R` `spatialpolygonsdataframe` object using
`plot()`.


    # create a plot of the shapefile
    # 'lwd' sets the line width
    # 'col' sets internal color
    # 'border' sets line color
    plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, col="cyan1", border="black", lwd=3,
         main="AOI Boundary Plot")

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Import Line and Point Shapefiles
Using the steps above, import the HARV_roads and HARVtower_UTM18N layers into
`R`. Call the Harv_roads object `lines_HARV` and the HARVtower_UTM18N
`point_HARV`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of `R` spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent`for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?
</div>



## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
The `plot()` function can be used for basic plotting of spatial objects. 
We use the `add = TRUE` argument to overlay shapefiles on top of each other, as
we would when creating a map in a typical GIS application like QGIS.

We can use `main=""` to give our plot a title. If we want the title to span two
lines, we use `\n` where the line should break.


    # Plot multiple shapefiles
    plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, col = "lightgreen", 
         main="NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
    plot(lines_HARV, add = TRUE)
    
    # use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
    plot(point_HARV, add  = TRUE, pch = 19, col = "purple")

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Plot Raster & Vector Data Together


You can plot vector data layered on top of raster data using the `add=TRUE`
plot attribute. Create a plot that uses the NEON AOP Canopy Height Model `NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif` as a base layer. On top of the
CHM, please add:

* The study site AOI.
* Roads.
* The tower location.

Be sure to give your plot a meaningful title.
