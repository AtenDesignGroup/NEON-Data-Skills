## REVIEW


## Spatial Resolution & Spatial Extent

A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel represents an area of space on the Earthâ€™s surface. The size of the area on the surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell (in meters in this example). This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel represents.

    <figcaption>A raster at the same extent with more pixels will have a higher resolution (it looks more "crisp"). A raster that is stretched over the same extent with fewer pixels will look more blury and will be of lower resolution.

#### Getting Started with CRS

Check out this short video highlighting how map projections can make continents
look proportionally larger or smaller than they actually are!

## What is a Coordinate Reference System

To define the location of something we often use a coordinate system. This system
consists of an X and a Y value, located within a 2 (or more) -dimensional space.

	<img src="http://open.senecac.on.ca/clea/label/projectImages/15_276_xy-grid.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption> We use coordinate systems with X, Y (and sometimes Z axes) to
	define the location of objects in space.

</figure>

While the above coordinate system is 2-dimensional, we live on a 3-dimensional
earth that happens to be "round". To define the location of objects on the earth, which is round, we need
a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth's shape. When we make maps on paper
or on a flat computer screen, we move from a 3-Dimensional space (the globe) to
a 2-Dimensional space (our computer
screens or a piece of paper). The components of the CRS define how the
"flattening" of data that exists in a 3-D globe space. The CRS also defines the
the coordinate system itself.

coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical
entities. -- Wikipedia

## The Components of a CRS

The coordinate reference system is made up of several key components:

* **Coordinate System:** the X, Y grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define
where a point is located in space.
* **Horizontal and vertical units:** The units used to define the grid along the
x, y (and z) axis.
* **Datum:** A modeled version of the shape of the earth which defines the
origin used to place the coordinate system in space. We will explain this further,
below.
* **Projection Information:** the mathematical equation used to flatten objects
that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface
(e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).


## Why CRS is Important

It is important to understand the coordinate system that your data uses -
particularly if you are working with different data stored in different coordinate
systems. If you have data from the same location that are stored in different
coordinate reference systems, **they will not line up in any GIS or other program**
unless you have a program like ArcGIS or QGIS that supports **projection on the
fly**. Even if you work in a tool that supports projection on the fly, you will
want to all of your data in the same projection for performing analysis and processing
tasks.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Spatialreference.org provides an
excellent <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">online
library of CRS information.</a>
