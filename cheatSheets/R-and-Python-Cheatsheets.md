# Coding Cheatsheets
I'll admit it, i'm a huge fan of cheat sheets. I am often jumping between programs and languages and it's insanely easy to get syntax mixed up. A running list is below. If you have others, share them in the comments below and i'll add them to the list! Cheers!

# Cheatsheets for R 

* This is a nice <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/03/17/r-cheat-sheet-for-graphical-parameters/" target="_blank"> cheatsheet for figures in R. Thanks to @flowingdata on twitter.
* Rstudio has developed  <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/?utm_content=buffer756d6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer/" target="_blank">a series of cheat sheets</a> that are pretty nice. My favorite is the data wrangling one!
* Nic Webber shared this <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/?utm_content=buffer756d6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer/" target="_blank">R-Python-Matlab cheat sheet</a>. This one is great if you're like me and constantly jumping between programs.


# Cheatsheets for Python 
oh, how sad. I haven't discovered any as of yet.
