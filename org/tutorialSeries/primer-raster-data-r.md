The series introduces the concepts through videos, graphical examples, 
and text. 

Data used in this series are from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) 
and are in GeoTiff and .csv formats.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Series

### Setup RStudio
To complete some of the tutorials in this series, you will need an updated 
version of `R` and, preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 


### Download Data
All tutorials in this series use data from the San Joaquin Experimental Range, a
NEON field site.
