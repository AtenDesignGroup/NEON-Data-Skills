# Series Goals/Objectives
After completing the series you will:

* **Build & Work With Functions in R**
	+ Explain why we should divide programs into small, single-purpose functions.
	+ Use a function that takes parameters (input values).
	+ Return a value from a function.
	+ Set default values for function parameters.
	+ Write, or define, a function.
	+ Test and debug a function. (This section in construction).


## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Series

### Setup RStudio
To complete the tutorial series you will need an updated version of `R` and,
 preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 

### Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary `R` packages now. 

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **sp:** `install.packages("sp")`
