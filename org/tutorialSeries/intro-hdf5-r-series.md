# Series Goals / Objectives
After completing the series you will:

* Understand how data can be structured and stored in HDF5
* Understand how metadata can be added to an HDF5 file
* Know how to explore HDF5 files using HDFView, a free tool for viewing HDF4 
and HDF5 files
* Know how to work with HDF5 files in R
* Know how to work with time-series data within a nested HDF5 file


## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Series

### Setup RStudio
To complete some of the tutorials in this series, you will need an updated 
version of `R` and, preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 

### Download Data
Data is available for download in those tutorials that focus on teaching data
skills.
