## About
This tutorial series explain the background and necessary information for
working with temporal and spatial data in `R`.  

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down but haven't
worked with temporal or spatial data in `R` before.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson

### Setup RStudio
To complete the tutorial series you will need an updated version of `R` and,
 preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 


### Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary `R` Packages now.
