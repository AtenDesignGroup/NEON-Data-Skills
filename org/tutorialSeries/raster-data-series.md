## About
The tutorials in this series cover how to open, work with and plot
raster-format spatial data in `R`. Additional topics include working with 
spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference system), reprojecting spatial
data and working with raster time series data. 

Data used in this series cover NEON Harvard Forest and San Joaquin Experimental 
Range field sites and are in GeoTIFF and .csv formats.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down but haven't
worked with spatial data in `R` before.

# Series Goals / Objectives
After completing the series you will:

* **Raster 00**
	+ Understand what a raster dataset is and its fundamental attributes.
	+ Know how to explore raster attributes in `R`.
	+ Be able to import rasters into `R` using the `raster` package.
	+ Be able to quickly plot a raster file in `R`.
	+ Understand the difference between single- and multi-band rasters.
* **Raster 01**
	+ Know how to plot a single band raster in R.
	+ Know how to layer a raster dataset on top of a hillshade to create an elegant 
basemap.
* **Raster 02**
	+ Be able to reproject a raster in R.
* **Raster 03**
	+ Be able to to perform a subtraction (difference) between two rasters using 
raster math.
	+ Know how to perform a more efficient subtraction (difference) between two 
rasters using the raster `overlay()` function in R.
* **Raster 04**
	+ Know how to identify a single vs. a multi-band raster file.
	+ Be able to import multi-band rasters into `R` using the `raster` package.
	+ Be able to plot multi-band color image rasters in `R` using `plotRGB`.
	+ Understand what a `NoData` value is in a raster.
* **Raster 05**
	+ Understand the format of a time series raster dataset.
	+ Know how to work with time series rasters. 
	+ Be able to efficiently import a set of rasters stored in a single directory.
	+ Be able to plot and explore time series raster data using the `plot()`
function in `R`.
* **Raster 06**
	+ Be able to assign custom names to bands in a RasterStack for prettier
plotting.
	+ Understand advanced plotting of rasters using the `rasterVis` package and
`levelplot`.
* **Raster 07**
	+ Be able to extract summary pixel values from a raster.
	+ Know how to save summary values to a .csv file.
	+ Be able to plot summary pixel values using `ggplot()`.
	+ Have experience comparing NDVI values between two different sites. 

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Series

### Setup RStudio
To complete the tutorial series you will need an updated version of `R` and,
 preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 

### Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary `R` Packages now. 

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **rasterVis:** `install.packages("rasterVis")`
* **ggplot2:** `install.packages("ggplot2")`
