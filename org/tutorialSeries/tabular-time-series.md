## About
The tutorials in this series cover how to open, work with and plot with 
phenology-related micrometeorological data in `R`.  Additional topics include
working with time and date classes (e.g., POSIXct, POSIXlt, and Date), 
subsetting time series data by date and time and created facetted or tiles 
sets of plots.

Data used in this series cover NEON Harvard Forest Field Site and are in .csv
or .txt file formats. 

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down but haven't
previously worked with time-series data in `R`.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson

### Setup RStudio
To complete the tutorial series you will need an updated version of `R` and,
 preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> 
is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a 
powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To interact with `R`, we strongly
recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
an interactive development environment (IDE). 

### Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary `R` packages now.
