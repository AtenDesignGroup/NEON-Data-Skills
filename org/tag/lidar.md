LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, is an active remote sensing system that 
can be used to, among other things, measure vegetation height across wide areas. 
The tutorials on this page will introduce you to the core concepts surrounding:

1. How LiDAR systems work.
2. What information the data provide.
3. How to view and work with LiDAR data using free tools.
4. The key raster (gridded) LiDAR data products including the canopy height model
 (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DTM).
4. Basic data analysis techniques using the R programming language.
