## Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Understand how HDF5 files can be created and structured in R using the 
rhdf5 libraries.
* Understand the three key HDF5 elements: the HDF5 file itself, groups, and datasets.
* Understand how to add and read attributes from an HDF5 file.


## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### R Libraries to Install:

* **rhdf5**: The rhdf5 package is hosted on Bioconductor not CRAN. Directions for 
installation are in the first code chunk.

We will use the file below in the optional challenge activity at the end of this 
tutorial.

## About HDF5
The HDF5 file can store large, heterogeneous datasets that include metadata. It 
also supports efficient `data slicing`, or extraction of particular subsets of a 
dataset which means that you don't have to read  large files read into the 
computers memory / RAM in their entirety in order work with them.

## HDF5 in R

To access HDF5 files in R, we will use the `rhdf5` library which is part of 
the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org" target="_blank">Bioconductor</a> 
suite of R libraries. It might also be useful to install 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/" target="_blank">the 
free HDF5 viewer</a> which will allow you to explore the contents of an HDF5 file 
using a graphic interface.

More about working with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore-data-hdfview" target="_blank">HDFview and a hands-on activity here.


First, let's get R setup. We will use the rhdf5 library. To access HDF5 files in 
R, we will use the rhdf5 library which is part of the Bioconductor suite of R 
packages. As of Aug. 2017 this package was not yet on CRAN. 


    # Install rhdf5 package (only need to run if not already installed)
    #install.packages("BiocManager")
    #BiocManager::install("rhdf5")
    
    # Call the R HDF5 Library
    library("rhdf5")
    
    # set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
    # we want to save our files
    #setwd("working-dir-path-here")

## Create an HDF5 File in R

Now, let's create a basic H5 file with one group and one dataset in it. 


    # Create hdf5 file
    h5createFile("vegData.h5")

    ## [1] TRUE

    h5createFile()

    ## Error in h5createFile(): argument "file" is missing, with no default

    # create a group called aNEONSite within the H5 file
    h5createGroup("vegData.h5", "aNEONSite")

    ## [1] TRUE

    # view the structure of the h5 we've created
    h5ls("vegData.h5")

    ##   group      name     otype dclass dim
    ## 0     / aNEONSite H5I_GROUP

Next, let's create some dummy data to add to our H5 file.


    # create some sample, numeric data 
    a <- rnorm(n=40, m=1, sd=1) 
    someData <- matrix(a,nrow=20,ncol=2)

Write the sample data to the H5 file.


    # add some sample data to the H5 file located in the aNEONSite group
    # we'll call the dataset "temperature"
    h5write(someData, file = "vegData.h5", name="aNEONSite/temperature")
    
    # let's check out the H5 structure again
    h5ls("vegData.h5")

    ##        group        name       otype dclass    dim
    ## 0          /   aNEONSite   H5I_GROUP              
    ## 1 /aNEONSite temperature H5I_DATASET  FLOAT 20 x 2

View a "dump" of the entire HDF5 file. NOTE: use this command with CAUTION if you
are working with larger datasets!


    # we can look at everything too 
    # but be cautious using this command!
    h5dump("vegData.h5")

    ## $aNEONSite
    ## $aNEONSite$temperature
    ##              [,1]       [,2]
    ##  [1,] -0.16420666  1.5755612
    ##  [2,]  1.80158536  2.1764389
    ##  [3,]  1.23803416  1.2927562
    ##  [4,]  2.05403693  0.1443593
    ##  [5,]  2.23946103  2.1377107
    ##  [6,]  1.43705166  1.5531153
    ##  [7,]  0.46404894  2.1324506
    ##  [8,]  0.16278415  0.3859432
    ##  [9,]  2.79255098  0.3576511
    ## [10,]  1.55760076  1.0051388
    ## [11,]  0.98733027 -0.2242752
    ## [12,]  2.42304247  0.9985014
    ## [13,]  0.38643231  0.3005682
    ## [14,] -1.33153535  1.3499627
    ## [15,]  1.20405715  1.3355688
    ## [16,] -0.08070397  1.7708422
    ## [17,]  3.11366962  1.1097622
    ## [18,]  0.17930508  0.8119678
    ## [19,]  0.87397956  1.7728203
    ## [20,]  1.35663142  1.2177682

    # Close the file. This is good practice.
    H5close()


## Add Metadata (attributes)

Let's add some metadata (called attributes in HDF5 land) to our dummy temperature
data. First, open up the file.


    # open the file, create a class
    fid <- H5Fopen("vegData.h5")
    # open up the dataset to add attributes to, as a class
    did <- H5Dopen(fid, "aNEONSite/temperature")
    
    # Provide the NAME and the ATTR (what the attribute says) for the attribute.
    h5writeAttribute(did, attr="Here is a description of the data",
                     name="Description")
    h5writeAttribute(did, attr="Meters",
                     name="Units")

Now we can add some attributes to the file. 


    # let's add some attributes to the group
    did2 <- H5Gopen(fid, "aNEONSite/")
    
    h5writeAttribute(did2, attr="San Joaquin Experimental Range",
                     name="SiteName")
    
    h5writeAttribute(did2, attr="Southern California",
                     name="Location")
    
    # close the files, groups and the dataset when you're done writing to them!
    H5Dclose(did)
    
    H5Gclose(did2)
    
    H5Fclose(fid)

## Working with an HDF5 File in R

Now that we've created our H5 file, let's use it! First, let's have a look at 
the attributes of the dataset and group in the file.


    # look at the attributes of the precip_data dataset
    h5readAttributes(file = "vegData.h5", 
                     name = "aNEONSite/temperature")

    ## $Description
    ## [1] "Here is a description of the data"
    ## 
    ## $Units
    ## [1] "Meters"

    # look at the attributes of the aNEONsite group
    h5readAttributes(file = "vegData.h5", 
                     name = "aNEONSite")

    ## $Location
    ## [1] "Southern California"
    ## 
    ## $SiteName
    ## [1] "San Joaquin Experimental Range"

    # let's grab some data from the H5 file
    testSubset <- h5read(file = "vegData.h5", 
                     name = "aNEONSite/temperature")
    
    testSubset2 <- h5read(file = "vegData.h5", 
                     name = "aNEONSite/temperature",
                     index=list(NULL,1))
    H5close()

Once we've extracted data from our H5 file, we can work with it
in R. 


    # create a quick plot of the data
    hist(testSubset2)

### Challenge: Work with HDF5 Files

Time to practice the skills you've learned. Open up the D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv 
in R. 

* Create a new HDF5 file called `vegStructure`.
* Add a group in your HDF5 file called `SJER`. 
* Add the veg structure data to that folder.
* Add some attributes the SJER group and to the data. 
* Now, repeat the above with the D17_2013_SOAP_vegStr csv.
* Name your second group SOAP

Hint: `read.csv()` is a good way to read in .csv files.
