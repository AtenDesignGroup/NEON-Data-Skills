<p>Plants change throughout the year - these are phenophases. 
Why do they change? </p>

<h2>Explore Phenology Data</h2>

<p>The following sections provide a brief overview of the NEON plant phenology 
observation data. When designing a research project using this data, you 
need to consult the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10055.001" target="_blank">documents associated with this data product</a> and not rely soley on this summary. </p>

<p><em>The following description of the NEON Plant Phenology Observation data is modified 
from the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON_phenology_userGuide_vA" target="_blank"> data product user guide</a>.</em></p>

<h3>NEON Plant Phenology Observation Data</h3>

<p>NEON collects plant phenology data and provides it as NEON data product 
<strong>NEON.DP1.10055</strong>.</p>

<p>The plant phenology observations data product provides in-situ observations of 
the phenological status and intensity of tagged plants (or patches) during 
discrete observations events. </p>

<p>Sampling occurs at all terrestrial field sites at site and season specific 
intervals. Three species for phenology observation are selected based on relative 
abundance in the Tower airshed. There are 30 individuals of each target species 
monitored at each transect. </p>

<h4>Status-based Monitoring</h4>

<p>NEON employs status-based monitoring, in which the phenological condition of an 
individual is reported any time that individual is observed. At every observations 
bout, records are generated for every phenophase that is occurring and for every 
phenophase not occurring. With this approach, events (such as leaf emergence in 
Mediterranean climates, or flowering in many desert species) that may occur 
multiple times during a single year, can be captured. Continuous reporting of
phenophase status enables quantification of the duration of phenophases rather 
than just their date of onset while allows enabling the explicit quantification 
of uncertainty in phenophase transition dates that are introduced by monitoring 
in discrete temporal bouts.</p>

<p>Specific products derived from this sampling include the observed phenophase 
status (whether or not a phenophase is occurring) and the intensity of 
phenophases for individuals in which phenophase status = ‘yes’. Phenophases 
reported are derived from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) categories. 
The number of phenophases observed varies by growth form and ranges from 1 
phenophase (cactus) to 7 phenophases (semi-evergreen broadleaf). 
In this tutorial we will focus only on the state of the phenophase, not the 
phenophase intensity data. </p>

<h4>Phenology Transects</h4>

<p>Plant phenology observations occurs at all terrestrial NEON sites along an 800 
meter square loop transect (primary) and within a 200 m x 200 m plot located 
within view of a canopy level, tower-mounted, phenology camera.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<h4>Timing of Observations</h4>

<p>At each site, there are: </p>

<ul>
<li>~50 observation bouts per year. </li>
<li>no more that 100 sampling points per phenology transect.</li>
<li>no more than 9 sampling points per phenocam plot. </li>
<li>1 bout per year to collect annual size and disease status measurements from 
each sampling point.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Available Data Tables</h4>

<p>In the downloaded data packet, data are available in two main files</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>phe_statusintensity:</strong> Plant phenophase status and intensity data </li>
<li><strong>phe_perindividual:</strong> Geolocation and taxonomic identification for phenology plants</li>
<li><strong>phe_perindividualperyear:</strong> recorded once a year, essentially the &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; 
about the plant: DBH, height, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are other files in each download including a <strong>readme</strong> with information on 
the data product and the download; a <strong>variables</strong> file that defines the 
term descriptions, data types, and units; a <strong>validation</strong> file with ata entry validation and 
parsing rules; and an <strong>XML</strong> with machine readable metadata. </p>

<h2>Stack NEON Data</h2>

<p>NEON data are delivered in a site and year-month format. When you download data,
you will get a single zipped file containing a directory for each month and site that you&#39;ve 
requested data for. Dealing with these separate tables from even one or two sites
over a 12 month period can be a bit overwhelming. Luckily NEON provides an R package
<strong>neonUtilities</strong> that takes the unzipped downloaded file and joining the data 
files. The teaching data downloaded with this tutorial is already stacked. If you
are working with other NEON data, please go through the tutorial to stack the data
in 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">R</a> or in <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-utilities-python" target="_blank">Python</a> 
and then return to this tutorial. </p>

<h2>Work with NEON Data</h2>

<p>When we do this for phenology data we get three files, one for each data table, 
with all the data from your site and date range of interest. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start by loading our data of interest. </p>

<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)  


# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
# setwd(&quot;working-dir-path-here&quot;)


# Read in data
ind &lt;- read.csv(&#39;NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_perindividual.csv&#39;, 
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE )

## Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file &#39;NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/
## phe_perindividual.csv&#39;: No such file or directory

## Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection

status &lt;- read.csv(&#39;NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_statusintensity.csv&#39;, 
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file &#39;NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/
## phe_statusintensity.csv&#39;: No such file or directory

## Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s explore the data. Let&#39;s get to know what the <code>ind</code> dataframe looks like.</p>

<pre><code># What are the fieldnames in this dataset?
names(ind)

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;ind&#39; not found

# how many rows are in the data?
nrow(ind)

## Error in nrow(ind): object &#39;ind&#39; not found

# look at the first six rows of data.
head(ind)

## Error in head(ind): object &#39;ind&#39; not found

# look at the structure of the dataframe.
str(ind)

## Error in str(ind): object &#39;ind&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you first open you data file in Excel, you might see 06/14/2014 as 
the format instead of 2014-06-14. Excel can do some <del>weird</del> interesting things
to dates.</p>

<h4>Individual locations</h4>

<p>To get the specific location data of each individual you would need to do some 
math, or you can use the NEON geolocation 
<a href="https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation" target="_blank"> <strong>geoNEON</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at the status data. </p>

<pre><code># What variables are included in this dataset?
names(status)

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;status&#39; not found

nrow(status)

## Error in nrow(status): object &#39;status&#39; not found

head(status)

## Error in head(status): object &#39;status&#39; not found

str(status)

## Error in str(status): object &#39;status&#39; not found

# date range
min(status$date)

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;status&#39; not found

max(status$date)

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;status&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>uid</code> is not important to understanding the data so we are going to remove <code>uid</code>. 
However, if you are every reporting an error in the data you should include this
with your report. </p>

<pre><code>ind &lt;- select(ind,-uid)

## Error in select(ind, -uid): object &#39;ind&#39; not found

status &lt;- select (status, -uid)

## Error in select(status, -uid): object &#39;status&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h2>Clean up the Data</h2>

<ul>
<li>remove duplicates (full rows)</li>
<li>convert date</li>
<li>retain only the latest <code>editedDate</code> in the perIndividual table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remove Duplicates</h3>

<p>The individual table (ind) file is included in each site by month-year file. As 
a result when all the tables are stacked there are many duplicates. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s remove any duplicates that exist.</p>

<pre><code># remove duplicates
## expect many

ind_noD &lt;- distinct(ind)

## Error in distinct(ind): object &#39;ind&#39; not found

nrow(ind_noD)

## Error in nrow(ind_noD): object &#39;ind_noD&#39; not found

status_noD&lt;-distinct(status)

## Error in distinct(status): object &#39;status&#39; not found

nrow(status_noD)

## Error in nrow(status_noD): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h3>Variable Overlap between Tables</h3>

<p>From the initial inspection of the data we can see there is overlap in variable
names between the fields. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what they are.</p>

<pre><code># where is there an intersection of names
sameName &lt;- intersect(names(status_noD), names(ind_noD))

## Error in intersect(names(status_noD), names(ind_noD)): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found

sameName

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;sameName&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>There are several fields that overlap between the datasets. Some of these are
expected to be the same and will be what we join on. </p>

<p>However, some of these will have different values in each table. We want to keep 
those distinct value and not join on them. </p>

<p>We want to rename common fields before joining:</p>

<ul>
<li>editedDate</li>
<li>measuredBy</li>
<li>recordedBy</li>
<li>samplingProtocolVersion</li>
<li>remarks</li>
<li>dataQF</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we want to rename the variables that would have duplicate names. We can 
rename all the variables in the status object to have &ldquo;Stat&rdquo; at the end of the 
variable name. </p>

<pre><code># rename status editedDate
status_noD &lt;- rename(status_noD, editedDateStat=editedDate, 
        measuredByStat=measuredBy, recordedByStat=recordedBy, 
        samplingProtocolVersionStat=samplingProtocolVersion, 
        remarksStat=remarks, dataQFStat=dataQF)

## Error in rename(status_noD, editedDateStat = editedDate, measuredByStat = measuredBy, : object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h3>Convert to Date</h3>

<p>Our <code>addDate</code> and <code>date</code> columns are stored as a <code>character</code> class. We need to 
convert it to a date class. The <code>as.Date()</code> function in base R will do this. </p>

<pre><code># convert column to date class
ind_noD$editedDate &lt;- as.Date(ind_noD$editedDate)

## Error in as.Date(ind_noD$editedDate): object &#39;ind_noD&#39; not found

str(ind_noD$editedDate)

## Error in str(ind_noD$editedDate): object &#39;ind_noD&#39; not found

status_noD$date &lt;- as.Date(status_noD$date)

## Error in as.Date(status_noD$date): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found

str(status_noD$date)

## Error in str(status_noD$date): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>The individual (ind) table contains all instances that any of the location or 
taxonomy data of an individual was updated. Therefore there are many rows for
some individuals.  We only want the latest <code>editedDate</code> on ind. </p>

<pre><code># retain only the max of the date for each individualID
ind_last &lt;- ind_noD %&gt;%
    group_by(individualID) %&gt;%
    filter(editedDate==max(editedDate))

## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object &#39;ind_noD&#39; not found

# oh wait, duplicate dates, retain only one
ind_lastnoD &lt;- ind_last %&gt;%
    group_by(editedDate, individualID) %&gt;%
    filter(row_number()==1)

## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object &#39;ind_last&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h3>Join Dataframes</h3>

<p>Now we can join the two data frames on all the variables with the same name. 
We use a <code>left_join()</code> from the dpylr package because we want to match all the 
rows from the &ldquo;left&rdquo; (first) dateframe to any rows that also occur in the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
 (second) dataframe.  </p>

<p>Check out RStudio&#39;s 
 <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank"> data wrangling (dplyr/tidyr) cheatsheet</a>
 for other types of joins. </p>

<pre><code># Create a new dataframe &quot;phe_ind&quot; with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind &lt;- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)

## Error in left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>Ack!  Two different data types.  Why?  Notice that when we checked for intersecting variable names, <code>data</code> was one of these variables. We didn&#39;t change the <code>data</code> column in the ind object from a <code>character</code> class to a date class. But, we actually don&#39;t want to combine these two <code>date</code> columns.</p>

<p>Try it again.  </p>

<p>We can rename the <code>date</code> column in ind so that the two dataframes can now join together.</p>

<pre><code># rename variables in ind
ind_noD &lt;- rename(ind_noD, addDate = date)

## Error in rename(ind_noD, addDate = date): object &#39;ind_noD&#39; not found

# Create a new dataframe &quot;phe_ind&quot; with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind &lt;- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)

## Error in left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD): object &#39;status_noD&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>Worked this time! 
Now that we have clean datasets we can begin looking into our particular data to 
address our research question: do plants show patterns of changes in phenophase 
across season?</p>

<h2>Patterns in Phenophase</h2>

<p>From our larger dataset (several sites, species, phenophases), let&#39;s create a
dataframe with only the data from a single site, species, and phenophase and 
call it <code>phe_1sp</code>.</p>

<h2>Select Site(s) of Interest</h2>

<p>To do this, we&#39;ll first select our site of interest. Note how we set this up 
with an object that is our site of interest. This will allow us to more easily change 
which site or sites if we want to adapt our code later. </p>

<pre><code># set site of interest
siteOfInterest &lt;- &quot;SCBI&quot;

# use filter to select only the site of Interest 
## using %in% allows one to add a vector if you want more than one site. 
## could also do it with == instead of %in% but won&#39;t work with vectors

phe_1sp &lt;- filter(phe_ind, siteID %in% siteOfInterest)

## Error in filter(phe_ind, siteID %in% siteOfInterest): object &#39;phe_ind&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h2>Select Species of Interest</h2>

<p>And now select a single species of interest. For now let&#39;s choose the flowering 
tree <em>Liriodendron tulipifera</em> (LITU). </p>

<pre><code># see which species are present
unique(phe_1sp$taxonID)

## Error in unique(phe_1sp$taxonID): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

speciesOfInterest &lt;- &quot;LITU&quot;

#subset to just &quot;LITU&quot;
# here just use == but could also use %in%
phe_1sp &lt;- filter(phe_1sp, taxonID==speciesOfInterest)

## Error in filter(phe_1sp, taxonID == speciesOfInterest): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$taxonID)

## Error in unique(phe_1sp$taxonID): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h2>Select Phenophase of Interest</h2>

<p>And, perhaps a single phenophase. </p>

<pre><code># see which species are present
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)

## Error in unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

phenophaseOfInterest &lt;- &quot;Leaves&quot;

#subset to just the phenosphase of Interest 
phe_1sp &lt;- filter(phe_1sp, phenophaseName %in% phenophaseOfInterest)

## Error in filter(phe_1sp, phenophaseName %in% phenophaseOfInterest): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)

## Error in unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<h2>Total in Phenophase of Interest</h2>

<p>The <code>phenophaseState</code> is recorded as &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; that the individual is in that
phenophase. The <code>phenophaseIntensity</code> are categories for how much of the indvidual
is in that state. For now, we will stick with <code>phenophaseState</code>. </p>

<p>We can now calculate the total individual with that state. </p>

<p>Here we use pipes <code>%&gt;%</code> from the dpylr package to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; objects onto the next
function. </p>

<pre><code># Total in status by day
sampSize &lt;- count(phe_1sp, date)

## Error in count(phe_1sp, date): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

inStat &lt;- phe_1sp %&gt;%
    group_by(date) %&gt;%
  count(phenophaseStatus)

## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object &#39;phe_1sp&#39; not found

inStat &lt;- full_join(sampSize, inStat, by=&quot;date&quot;)

## Error in full_join(sampSize, inStat, by = &quot;date&quot;): object &#39;sampSize&#39; not found

# Retain only Yes
inStat_T &lt;- filter(inStat, phenophaseStatus %in% &quot;yes&quot;)

## Error in filter(inStat, phenophaseStatus %in% &quot;yes&quot;): object &#39;inStat&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the data we can plot it. </p>

<h2>Plot with ggplot</h2>

<p>The <code>ggplot()</code> function within the <code>ggplot2</code> package gives us considerable control
over plot appearance. Three basic elements are needed for <code>ggplot()</code> to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>data_frame:</strong> containing the variables that we wish to plot,</li>
<li><strong><code>aes</code> (aesthetics):</strong> which denotes which variables will map to the x-, y-
(and other) axes,<br/></li>
<li>**<code>geom_XXXX</code> (geometry):** which defines the data&#39;s graphical representation
(e.g. points (<code>geom_point</code>), bars (<code>geom_bar</code>), lines (<code>geom_line</code>), etc).</li>
</ol>

<p>The syntax begins with the base statement that includes the <code>data_frame</code>
(<code>inStat_T</code>) and associated x (<code>date</code>) and y (<code>n</code>) variables to be
plotted:</p>

<p><code>ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, n))</code></p>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** For a more detailed introduction to

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-time-series-plot-ggplot-r" target="_blank"> *Time Series 05: Plot Time Series with ggplot2 in R* tutorial</a>. 
</div>

<h3>Bar Plots with ggplot</h3>

<p>To successfully plot, the last piece that is needed is the <code>geom</code>etry type. 
To create a bar plot, we set the <code>geom</code> element from to <code>geom_bar()</code>.  </p>

<p>The default setting for a ggplot bar plot -  <code>geom_bar()</code> - is a histogram
designated by <code>stat=&quot;bin&quot;</code>. However, in this case, we want to plot count values. 
We can use <code>geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)</code> to force ggplot to plot actual values.</p>

<p>The plots demonstrate that, while the 2016 data show the nice expected pattern 
of increasing leaf-out, peak, and drop-off, we seem to be missing the increase 
in leaf-out in 2015. Looking at the data, we see that there was no data collected
before May of 2015 &ndash; we&#39;re missing most of leaf out!</p>

<h2>Filter by Date</h2>

<p>That may create problems with downstream analyses. Let&#39;s filter the dataset to 
include just 2016.</p>

<pre><code># use filter to select only the site of Interest 
phe_1sp_2016 &lt;- filter(inStat_T, date &gt;= &quot;2016-01-01&quot;)

## Error in filter(inStat_T, date &gt;= &quot;2016-01-01&quot;): object &#39;inStat_T&#39; not found

# did it work?
range(phe_1sp_2016$date)

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;phe_1sp_2016&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>How does that look? </p>

<pre><code># Now let&#39;s make the plot look a bit more presentable

    geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, na.rm = TRUE) +

<h2>Drivers of Phenology</h2>

<p>Now that we see that there are differences in and shifts in phenophases, what 
are the drivers of phenophases?</p>

<p>The NEON phenology measurements track sensitive and easily observed indicators 
of biotic responses to climate variability by monitoring the timing and duration 
of phenological stagesin plant communities. Plant phenology is affected by forces 
such as temperature, timing and duration of pest infestations and disease outbreaks, 
water fluxes, nutrient budgets, carbon dynamics, and food availability and has 
feedbacks to trophic interactions, carbon sequestration, community composition 
and ecosystem function.  (quoted from
