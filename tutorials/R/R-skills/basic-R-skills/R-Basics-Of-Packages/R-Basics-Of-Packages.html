<h2>About Packages in R</h2>

<p>Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a 
well-defined format. When you install a package it gives you access to a set 
of commands that are not available in the base R set of functions. The directory
where packages are stored is called the library. R comes with a standard set of 
packages. Others are available for download and installation. Once installed, 
they have to be loaded into the session to be used.</p>

<h2>Installing Packages in R</h2>

<p>To install a package you have to know where to get the package.  Most established
packages are available from 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">&ldquo;CRAN&rdquo;</a> or the Comprehensive
R Archive Network. </p>

<p>Packages download from specific CRAN &ldquo;mirrors&rdquo;&ldquo; where the packages are saved 
(assuming that a binary, or set of installation files, is available for your 
operating system). If you have not set a preferred CRAN mirror in your 
<code>options()</code>, then a menu will pop up asking you to choose a location from which 
you&#39;d like to install your packages.</p>

<p>To install any package from CRAN, you use <code>install.packages()</code>.  You only need to 
install packages the first time you use R (or after updating to a new version). </p>

<pre><code># install the ggplot2 package
install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)  
</code></pre>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**R Tip:** You can just type this into the command 
line of R to install each package. Once a package is installed, you don&rsquo;t have 
to install it again while using the version of R!
</div>

<h2>Use a Package</h2>

<p>Once a package is installed (basically the functions are downloaded to your 
computer), you need to &quot;call&rdquo; the package into the current session of R.  This 
is essentially like saying, &ldquo;Hey R, I will be using these functions now, please 
have them ready to go&rdquo;.  You have to do this ever time you start a new R session,
so this should be at the top of your script. </p>

<p>When you want to call a package, use <code>library(PackageNameHere)</code>. You may also 
see some people using <code>require()</code> &ndash; while that works in most cases, it does 
function slightly differently and best practice is to use <code>library()</code>.  </p>

<pre><code># load the package
library(ggplot2)
</code></pre>

<h2>What Packages are Installed Now?</h2>

<p>If you want to use a package, but aren&#39;t sure if you&#39;ve installed it before,
you can check! In code you, can use <code>installed.packages()</code>.  </p>

<pre><code># check installed packages
installed.packages()
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using RStudio, you can also check out the Packages tab. It will list
all the currently installed packages and have a check mark next to them if they 
are currently loaded and ready to use. You can also update and install packages
from this tab.  While you can &ldquo;call&rdquo; a package from here too by checking the box
I wouldn&#39;t recommend this as calling the package isn&#39;t in your script and you 
if you run the script again this could trip you up!</p>

<h2>Updating Packages</h2>

<p>Sometimes packages are updated by the users who created them. Updating packages 
can sometimes make changes to both the package and also to how your code runs. 
** If you already have a lot of code using a package, be cautious about updating 
packages as some functionality may change or disappear.**  </p>

<p>Otherwise, go ahead and update old packages so things are up to date.</p>

<p>In code you, can use <code>old.packages()</code> to check to see what packages are out of 
date. </p>

<p><code>update.packages()</code> will update all packages in the known libraries 
interactively. This can take a while if you haven&#39;t done it recently! To update 
everything without any user intervention, use the <code>ask = FALSE</code> argument.</p>

<p>If you only want to update a single package, the best way to do it is using
<code>install.packages()</code> again.</p>

<pre><code># list all packages where an update is available
old.packages()

# update all available packages
update.packages()

# update, without prompts for permission/clarification
update.packages(ask = FALSE)

# update only a specific package use install.packages()
install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>In <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>, you can also 
manage packages using Tools -&gt; Install Packages.</p>

### Challenge: Installing Packages

Check to see if you can install the dplyr package or a package of interest to
you. 

1. Check to see if the dplyr package is installed on your computer.
1. If it is not installed, install the &ldquo;dplyr&rdquo; package in R.
1. If installed, is it up to date?
