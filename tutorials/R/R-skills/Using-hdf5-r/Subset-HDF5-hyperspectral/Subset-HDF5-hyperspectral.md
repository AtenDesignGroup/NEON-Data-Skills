In this tutorial, we will subset an existing HDF5 file containing NEON 
hyperspectral data. The purpose of this exercise is to generate a smaller 
file for use in subsequent analyses to reduce the file transfer time and 
processing power needed.

## Why subset your dataset? 
There are many reasons why you may wish to subset your HDF5 file. 
Primarily, HDF5 files may contain a large amount of information 
that is not necessary for your purposes. By subsetting the file, 
you can reduce file size, thereby shrinking your storage needs, 
shortening file transfer/download times, and reducing your processing 
time for analysis. In this example, we 
will take a full HDF5 file of NEON hyperspectral reflectance data 
from the San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) that has a file size 
of ~652 Mb and make a new HDF5 file with a reduced spatial extent, 
and a reduced spectral resolution, yeilding a file of only ~50.1 Mb. 
This reduction in file size will make it easier and faster to conduct 
your analysis and to share your data with others. We will then use this 
subsetted file in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data* series</a>.

If you find that downloading the full 652 Mb file takes too much 
time or storage space, you will find a link to this subsetted file 
at the top of each lesson in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data* series</a>.

## Exploring the NEON hyperspectral HDF5 file structure

In order to determine what information that we want to put into our subset, we 
should first take a look at the full NEON hyperspectral HDF5 file structure to 
see what is included. To do so, we will load the required package for this 
tutorial (you can un-comment the middle two lines to load 'BiocManager' and 
'rhdf5' if you don't already have it on your computer).


    # Install rhdf5 package (only need to run if not already installed)
    # install.packages("BiocManager")
    # BiocManager::install("rhdf5")
    
    # Load required packages
    library(rhdf5)

Next, we define our working directory where we have saved the full HDF5 
file of NEON hyperspectral reflectance data from the SJER site. Note,
the filepath to the working directory will depend on your local environment.
Then, we create a string (`f`) of the HDF5 filename and read its attributes.


    # set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
    # we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
    wd <- "~/Documents/data/" # This will depend on your local environment
    setwd(wd)
    
    # Make the name of our HDF5 file a variable
    f_full <- paste0(wd,"NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5")

Next, let's take a look at the structure of the full NEON hyperspectral 
reflectance HDF5 file.


    View(h5ls(f_full, all=T))

Wow, there is a lot of information in there! The majority of the groups contained 
within this file are Metadata, most of which are used for processing the raw 
observations into the reflectance product that we want to use. For demonstration 
and teaching purposes, we will not need this information. What we will need are 
things like the Coordinate_System information (so that we can georeference these 
data), the Wavelength dataset (so that we can match up each band with its appropriate 
wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum), and of course the Reflectance_Data 
themselves. You can also see that each group and dataset has a number of associated 
attributes (in the 'num_attrs' column). We will want to copy over those attributes 
into the data subset as well. But first, we need to define each of the groups that 
we want to populate in our new HDF5 file.

## Create new HDF5 file framework

In order to make a new subset HDF5 file, we first must create an empty file 
with the appropriate name, then we will begin to fill in that file with the 
essential data and attributes that we want to include. Note that the function 
`h5createFile()` will not overwrite an existing file. Therefore, if you have 
already created or downloaded this file, the function will throw an error! 
Each function should return 'TRUE' if it runs correctly.


    # First, create a name for the new file
    f <- paste0(wd, "NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")
    
    # create hdf5 file
    h5createFile(f)

    ## [1] TRUE

    # Now we create the groups that we will use to organize our data
    h5createGroup(f, "SJER/")

    ## [1] TRUE

    h5createGroup(f, "SJER/Reflectance")

    ## [1] TRUE

    h5createGroup(f, "SJER/Reflectance/Metadata")

    ## [1] TRUE

    h5createGroup(f, "SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System")

    ## [1] TRUE

    h5createGroup(f, "SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data")

    ## [1] TRUE

## Adding group attributes

One of the great things about HDF5 files is that they can contain 
*data* and *attributes* within the same group. 
As explained within the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hdf5-r-series" target="_blank"> Introduction to Working with HDF5 Format in R series</a>, 
attributes are a type of metadata that are associated with an HDF5 group or 
dataset. There may be multiple attributes associated with each group and/or 
dataset. Attributes come with a name and an associated array of information. 
In this tutorial, we will read the existing attribute data from the full 
hyperspectral tile using the `h5readAttributes()` function (which returns 
a `list` of attributes), then we loop through those attributes and write 
each attribute to its appropriate group using the `h5writeAttribute()` function.

First, we will do this for the low-level "SJER/Reflectance" group. In this step, 
we are adding attributes to a *group* rather than a *dataset*. To do so, we must 
first open a file and group interface using the `H5Fopen` and `H5Gopen` functions, 
then we can use `h5writeAttribute()` to edit the group that we want to give 
an attribute.


    a <- h5readAttributes(f_full,"/SJER/Reflectance/")
    fid <- H5Fopen(f)
    g <- H5Gopen(fid, "SJER/Reflectance")
    
    for(i in 1:length(names(a))){
      h5writeAttribute(attr = a[[i]], h5obj=g, name=names(a[i]))
    }
    
    # It's always a good idea to close the file connection immidiately
    # after finishing each step that leaves an open connection.
    h5closeAll()

Next, we will loop through each of the datasets within the Coordinate_System 
group, and copy those (and their attributes, if present) from the full tile 
to our subset file. The Coordinate_System group contains many important pieces 
of information for geolocating our data, so we need to make sure that the 
subset file has that information.


    # make a list of all groups within the full tile file
    ls <- h5ls(f_full,all=T)
    
    # make a list of all of the names within the Coordinate_System group
    cg <- unique(ls[ls$group=="/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System",]$name)
    
    # Loop through the list of datasets that we just made above
    for(i in 1:length(cg)){
      print(cg[i])
      
      # Read the inividual dataset within the Coordinate_System group
      d=h5read(f_full,paste0("/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/",cg[i]))
    
      # Read the associated attributes (if any)
      a=h5readAttributes(f_full,paste0("/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/",cg[i]))
        
      # Assign the attributes (if any) to the dataset
      attributes(d)=a
      
      # Finally, write the dataset to the HDF5 file
      h5write(obj=d,file=f,
              name=paste0("/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/",cg[i]),
              write.attributes=T)
    }

## Spectral Subsetting

The goal of subsetting this dataset is to substantially reduce the file size, 
making it faster to download and process these data. While each AOP mosaic tile 
is not particularly large in terms of its spatial scale (1km by 1km at 1m 
resolution= 1,000,000 pixels, or about half as many pixels at shown on a standard 
1080p computer screen), the 426 spectral bands available result in a fairly large 
file size. Therefore, we will reduce the spectral resolution of these data by 
selecting every fourth band in the dataset, which reduces the file size to 1/4 
of the original! 

Some circumstances demand the full spectral resolution file. For example, if you 
wanted to discern between the spectral signatures of similar minerals, or if you 
were conducting an analysis of the differences in the 'red edge' between plant 
functional types, you would want to use the full spectral resolution of the 
original hyperspectral dataset. Still, we can use far fewer bands for demonstration 
and teaching purposes, while still getting a good sense of what these hyperspectral 
data can do.


    # First, we make our 'index', a list of number that will allow us to select every fourth band, using the "sequence" function seq()
    idx <- seq(from = 1, to = 426, by = 4)
    
    # We then use this index to select particular wavelengths from the full tile using the "index=" argument
    wavelengths <- h5read(file = f_full, 
                 name = "SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength", 
                 index = list(idx)
                )
    
    # As per above, we also need the wavelength attributes
    wavelength.attributes <- h5readAttributes(file = f_full, 
                           name = "SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")
    attributes(wavelengths) <- wavelength.attributes
    
    # Finally, write the subset of wavelengths and their attributes to the subset file
    h5write(obj=wavelengths, file=f,
            name="SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength",
            write.attributes=T)

## Spatial Subsetting

Even after spectral subsetting, our file size would be greater than 100Mb. 
herefore, we will also perform a *spatial* subsetting process to further 
reduce our file size. Now, we need to figure out which part of the full image 
that we want to extract for our subset. It takes a number of steps in order 
to read in a band of data and plot the reflectance values - all of which are 
thoroughly described in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank"> *Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format in R*</a> 
tutorial. For now, let's focus on the essentials for our problem at hand. In 
order to explore the spatial qualities of this dataset, let's plot a single 
band as an overview map to see what objects and land cover types are contained 
within this mosaic tile. The Reflectance_Data dataset has three dimensions in 
the order of bands, columns, rows. We want to extract a single band, and all 
1,000 columns and rows, so we will feed those values into the `index=` argument 
as a `list`. For this example, we will select the 58th band in the hyperspectral 
dataset, which corresponds to a wavelength of 667nm, which is in the red end of 
the visible electromagnetic spectrum. We will use `NULL` in the column and row 
position to indicate that we want *all* of the columns and rows (we agree that 
it is weird that `NULL` indicates "all" in this circumstance, but that is the 
default behavior for this, and many other, functions).



    # Extract or "slice" data for band 58 from the HDF5 file
    b58 <- h5read(f_full,name = "SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
                 index=list(58,NULL,NULL))
    h5closeAll()
    
    # convert from array to matrix
    b58 <- b58[1,,]
    
    # Make a plot to view this band
    image(log(b58), col=grey(0:100/100))

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/tutorials/R/R-skills/Using-hdf5-r/Subset-HDF5-hyperspectral/rfigs/plot-example-band-1.png)

As we can see here, this hyperspectral reflectance tile contains a school campus 
that is under construction. There are many different land cover types contained 
here, which makes it a great example! Perhaps the most unique feature shown is in 
the bottom right corner of this image, where we can see the tip of a small reservoir. 
Let's be sure to capture this feature in our spatial subset, as well as a few other 
land cover types (irrigated grass, trees, bare soil, and buildings).

While raster images count their pixels from the top left corner, we are working 
with a matrix, which counts its pixels from the bottom left corner. Therefore, 
rows are counted from the bottom to the top, and columns are counted from the 
left to the right. If we want to sample the bottom right quadrant of this image, 
we need to select rows 1 through 500 (bottom half), and columns 501 through 1000 
(right half). Note that, as above, the `index=` argument in `h5read()` requires 
a `list` of three dimenstions for this example - in the order of bands, columns, 
rows. 


    subset_rows <- 1:500
    subset_columns <- 501:1000
    # Extract or "slice" data for band 44 from the HDF5 file
    b58 <- h5read(f_full,name = "SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
                 index=list(58,subset_columns,subset_rows))
    h5closeAll()
    
    # convert from array to matrix
    b58 <- b58[1,,]
    
    # Make a plot to view this band
    image(log(b58), col=grey(0:100/100))

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/tutorials/R/R-skills/Using-hdf5-r/Subset-HDF5-hyperspectral/rfigs/plot-example-band-subset-1.png)

Perfect - now we have a spatial subset that includes all of the different land 
cover types that we are interested in investigating. 

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Pick your subset

1. Pick your own area of interest for this spatial subset, and find the rows and 
columns that capture that area. Can you include some solar panels, as well as 
the water body?

2. Does it make a difference if you use a band from another part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, such as the near-infrared? Hint: you can use the 
'wavelengths' function above while removing the `index=` argument to get the 
full list of band wavelengths.

</div>

## Extracting a subset

Now that we have determined our ideal spectral and spatial subsets for our 
analysis, we are ready to put both of those pieces of information into our 
`h5read()` function to extract our example subset out of the full NEON 
hyperspectral dataset. Here, we are taking every fourth band (using our `idx` 
variabe), columns 501:1000 (the right half of the tile) and rows 1:500 (the 
bottom half of the tile). The results in us extracting every fourth band of 
the bottom-right quadrant of the mosaic tile.


    # Read in reflectance data.
    # Note the list that we feed into the index argument! 
    # This tells the h5read() function which bands, rows, and 
    # columns to read. This is ultimately how we reduce the file size.
    hs <- h5read(file = f_full, 
                 name = "SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data", 
                 index = list(idx, subset_columns, subset_rows)
                )

As per the 'adding group attributes' section above, we will need to add the 
attributes to the hyperspectral data (`hs`) before writing to the new HDF5 
subset file (`f`). The `hs` variable already has one attribute, `$dim`, which 
contains the actual dimensions of the `hs` array, and will be important for 
writing the array to the `f` file later. We will want to combine this attribute 
with all of the other Reflectance_Data group attributes from the original HDF5 
file, `f`. However, some of the attributes will no longer be valid, such as the 
`Dimensions` and `Spatial_Extent_meters` attributes, so we will need to overwrite 
those before assigning these attributes to the `hs` variable to then write to 
the `f` file.


    # grab the '$dim' attribute - as this will be needed 
    # when writing the file at the bottom
    hsd <- attributes(hs)
    
    # We also need the attributes for the reflectance data.
    ha <- h5readAttributes(file = f_full, 
                           name = "SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data")
    
    # However, some of the attributes are not longer valid since 
    # we changed the spatial extend of this dataset. therefore, 
    # we will need to overwrite those with the correct values.
    ha$Dimensions <- c(500,500,107) # Note that the HDF5 file saves dimensions in a different order than R reads them
    ha$Spatial_Extent_meters[1] <- ha$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]+500
    ha$Spatial_Extent_meters[3] <- ha$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]+500
    attributes(hs) <- c(hsd,ha)
    
    # View the combined attributes to ensure they are correct
    attributes(hs)

            name="SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
            write.attributes=T)

    h5closeAll()

That's it! We just created a subset of the original HDF5 file, and included the 
most essential groups and metadata for exploratory analysis. You may consider 
adding other information, such as the weather quality indicator, when subsetting 
datasets for your own purposes.

If you want to take a look at the subset that you just made, run the `h5ls()` function:
