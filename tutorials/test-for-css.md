This page shows all the NEON stylings as currently shown on the
<a href="http://neonscience.github.io/NEON-Lesson-Building-Data-Skills/example-post" target="_blank"> NEONDataSkills.org website</a>.  

## Basic Markdown Highlighting

This is basic markdown styling and should need special CSS. 

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when used
in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*. 

## Rule

This is a rule (horizontal line) in markdown.

***

# Heading one

## Heading two

### Heading three

#### Heading four


Below are the various styles that are used throughout the NEON Data Skills pages. 
For those that have CSS styles that are not yet resolved I give several options. 


## GreyBox

This is the "Greybox" styling. The div tag is currently (leaving out the < > so it isn't recognized as html): 

`div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1"`  


<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need the most current version of `R` and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded
on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **sp:** `install.packages("sp")`

### Download Data

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Field-Site-Spatial-Data.html %}

## Tutorial Series 
These capstone activities rely on skills learned in the 

* <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/spatial-data-types-primer/" target="_blank"> *Primer on Raster Data* series</a>,
* <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/intro-hsi-r-series/" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data - in R* series</a>, or
* <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/intro-hdf5-r-series/" target="_blank"> *Introduction to the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) - Using HDFView & R* series</a>.
 
</div>




## Code chunks

### R

In RMarkdown code chunks look like this (start with ```{r name-here}, and closed with ```).  

```{r code-chunk}

# add 1 +1
1+1
2
```

In Markdown code chunks look like this (indent only).


	 # add 1 +1
	 1+1
	 2

Notice in the above code `# add 1+1` should be highlighted as a comment, `1+1` 
should be highlighted as input, and `2` should be highlighted as output. All 
should be visually seperate from the surrounding text. 


I could make code chunks look like this if needed. This is designated with: 

div id="ds-code-r" markdown="1"


<div id="ds-code-r" markdown="1">

	 # add 1 +1
	 1+1
	 2

</div>  

### Python 

However, we also have code in other languages too. Python currently looks like 
this in the markdown. 

```python
#ls_dataset displays the name, shape, and type of datasets in hdf5 file
def ls_dataset(name,node):
    if isinstance(node, h5py.Dataset):
        print(node)
    
f.visititems(ls_dataset)
```


It could also be written like this. This is designated with:

div id="ds-code-python" markdown="1"


<div id="ds-code-python" markdown="1">

```python
#ls_dataset displays the name, shape, and type of datasets in hdf5 file
def ls_dataset(name,node):
    if isinstance(node, h5py.Dataset):
        print(node)
    
f.visititems(ls_dataset)

```
</div>  




## Data Tips

Originally it looked like this: 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Here is a block with a data tip. 
Sometimes it might have some `code` in it. A data tip can include a list or
links, however, it cannot contain figures, etc. 
{: .notice}

It was changed to look like this. 

<div id="ds-dataTip">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Here is a block with a data tip. 
Sometimes it might have some `code` in it. A data tip can include a list or
links, however, it cannot contain figures, etc. 
</div> 

Or could be written like this without the class:

<div id="ds-dataTip" >
**Data Tip:** Here is a block with a data tip. 
Sometimes it might have some `code` in it. A data tip can include a list or
links, however, it cannot contain figures, etc. 
</div> 






## Challenges

This is how it appears in Markdown. 

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Title of Challenge
  
Here is some challenge text.

* it can have bullets
* another bullet

or 

1. a numbered list
2. or two 

some more text here

**bolding stuff**

*italicize stuff*

It can have multiple paragraphs too.
</div>




## Quote Blocks

> Here is a quote block
> you can use all sorts of different spacing and bullets in it too
>
> * list one
> * list two
> but you have to use a `>` on each line for it to work which is a pain.
