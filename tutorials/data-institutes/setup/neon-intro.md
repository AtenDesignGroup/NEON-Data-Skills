Here we will provide an overview of the National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON). Please carefully read through these materials and links that
discuss NEON’s mission and design. 

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute participants**: As you review this information, please
consider the
<a href="/di-rs-capstone" target="_blank">capstone project </a>
that you may want to work on at the Institute. At the end of week one, you will 
document an initial research question or idea and associated data needed to 
address that question, that you may want to explore while at the NEON Data Institute.
</div>

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the mission of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
* Explain the how sites are located within the NEON project design.
* Explain the different types of data that will be collected and provided by
 NEON.
 </div>

## NEON Mission & Design

To capture ecological heterogeneity across the United States, NEON’s design
divides the continent into 20 statistically different eco-climatic domains. Each
NEON field site is located within an eco-climatic domain.

#### The Science and Design of NEON

Watch this 3:55 minute video explaining the NEON program.

### NEON Field Site Locations

Explore the NEON Field Site map taking note of the locations of

1. Aquatic & terrestrial field sites.
2. Core & relocatable field sites.

<a class="link--button link--arrow" href="/field-sites/field-sites-map" target="_blank">
Click here to view the NEON Field Site Map</a>

Explore the NEON field site map. Do the following:

* Zoom in on a study area of interest to see if there are any NEON field sites 
that are nearby.
* Click the "More" button in the **upper right hand** corner of the map to 
filter sites by name, site host, domain or state.
* Select one field site of interest.
  * Click on the marker in the map.
  * Then click on the name of the field site to jump to the field site landing page.

**NOTE:** Because NEON is still in it's construction phase, not all field sites 
have online documentation. We are working on this!

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute Participant -- Thought Questions:**
Use the map above to answer these questions. Consider the research question that you may explore as your
Capstone Project at the Institute OR about a current project that you are
working on and answer the following questions:

* Are there NEON field sites that are in study regions of interest to you?  
* What domains are the sites located in?  
* What NEON field sites do your current research or Capstone Project ideas
coincide with?  
* Is the site(s) core or relocatable?  
* Is it/are they terrestrial or aquatic?  
* Are there data available for the NEON field site(s) that you are most
interested in? What kind of data are available?

## The Data that NEON Collects

#### How NEON Collects Data
Watch this 3:06 minute video exploring the data that NEON collects. 
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9IbbdQC1N3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Read the
<a href="/data-collection" target="_blank"> Data Collection Methods </a>
page to learn more about the different types of data that NEON collects and
provides. Then, follow the links below to learn more about each collection method:

### Airborne Remote Sensing

Watch this 5 minute video to better understand the NEON Airborne Observation
Platform (AOP), if you didn't already on the AOP page.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute Participant – Thought Questions:** 
Consider either your current
or future research or the question you’d like to address at the Institute.

* Which types of data may be more useful to address these questions?
* What challenges, if any, could you foresee when beginning to work with these
data?
</div>

## Get NEON Data

NEON data are processed and quality control checked at NEON headquarters in Boulder, CO.
NEON carefully documents every aspect of sampling design, data collection,
processing and delivery. This documentation is freely available through the
NEON data portal.

**Read the following pages to learn more:**

* <a  href="/data/data-processing" target="_blank">
Read more about NEON data processing.</a>
* <a  href="/science-design/data-processing/product-documentation" target="_blank">
Read more about NEON methods documentation.</a>
* <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">
Visit the NEON Data Portal - data.neonscience.org </a>
* <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog" target="_blank">
Check out the NEON Data Product Catalog to see what will be available.</a>
* <a href="http://www.ibol.org/dna-barcodes-for-neons-terrestrial-insects/" target="_blank"> NEON Terrestrial Insect DNA Barcoding Data</a>
is available through the
<a href="http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/databases" target="_blank"> Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD) </a>.


If you want to start your search with a specific data prodcuat then you might
want to start your search in
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog" target="_blank">the NEON Data Products Catalog.</a>
Here you can find details about each data product including much of the metadata 
& documentation for the data product. .  

If you are instead primarily interested in data from a specific date range or 
comparisons between sites, then starting with the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/view-data-availability" target="_blank">the NEON Data Availability Matrix</a> 
may be the way to go. 


### Specimens & Samples
An overview of how to get data, soil or species samples, and supporting
documentation can always be found on the
<a href="/data/neon-data-portal" target="_blank"> Data page</a>.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute Participant – Thought Questions:** 
Use the Data Portal tools to investigate the data availability for the field
sites you’ve already identified in the previous Thought Questions. If your
desired field site doesn’t have data available for it, choose the next most
desirable one that does have data available.  

* What types of aquatic/terrestrial data are currently available? Remote sensing data?  
* Of these, what type of data are you most interested in working with for your project while at the Institute.  
* For what time period does the data cover?  
* What format is the downloadable file available in?  
* Where is the metadata to support this data?  
</div>



<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip:** NEON also provides support to your own 
research including proposals to fly the AOP over other study sites, a mobile 
tower/instrumentation setup and others. Learn more here the

**Data Institute Participants: Intro to NEON Culmination Activity**

Write up a brief summary of a project that you might want to explore while at the
Data Institute in Boulder, CO. Include the types of NEON (and other data) that you
will need to implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining 
and adding to your ideas over the next few weeks.

The goal of this activity if for you to begin to think about the project that you
wish to work on while at the Data Institute. This project will ideally be 
performed in groups, so over the next few weeks you'll have a chance to view the other
project proposals and merge projects to collaborate with your colleagues.
