## NEON Teaching Datasets
Many NEON data skills tutorials utilize teaching data subsets which are hosted 
on the NEON Data Skills 
<a href="https://figshare.com/authors/NEON_Data_Skills_Teaching_Data_Subsets" target="_blank">fig**share** repository</a> or the NEON AOP data distribution service.

We recommend downloading the complete Data Institute 2018 teaching data subsets 
from the buttons in the instructions below. 
The required dataset(s) will also be available to download at the start of each 
tutorial series in the **Download Data** section. 

## Download & Uncompress the Data

#### 1) Download
First, we will download the datasets to a location on the computer. To download the 
data for this event, click the blue buttons below.

### Download Data

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_DI18.html %}


</div>

After clicking on the **Download Data** button, you will be taken to a Citrix 
FileShare page.  Download the necessary files (select all, except as noted above). 

#### 2) Locate .zip file
Second, we need to find the downloaded .zip files. Many browsers default to 
downloading to the **Downloads** directory on your computer. 
Note: You may have previously specified a specific directory for files
downloaded from the internet, if so, the .zip file will download there. 

#### 3) Unzip/uncompress
Third, we need to unzip/uncompress the file so that the data files can be 
accessed. Use your favorite tool that can unpackage/open .zip files (e.g.,
winzip, Archive Utility, etc). Depending on the tool you use to uncompress the files,
you may need to individually uncompress the individual files
within the main file. 

#### 4) Move to **RSDI-2018** directory
Fourth, we must move the subdirectories containing the data files to the location we want to work with them. 
We recommend moving all the subdirecties to a dedicated **RSDI-2018** directory within your
**Documents** directory on your computer (**~/Documents/RSDI-2018**). This 
**RSDIDI-2018** directory can then be a repository for all data and notebooks you use 
for the NEON Data Institute tutorials. 

Note: If you chose to store your data in 
a different directory (e.g., not in **~/Documents/RSDI-2018**), modify 
the directions in all tutorial with the appropriate file path to your downloaded 
data. 

#### 5) Organize Data
Fifth, we need to put all three data subsets within an organized directory structure. 
We have decided to arrange them by the topics of the lessons themselves. See the
screen shot below for an arrangement that we will use for the 2018 Data Institute. 
This will allow us to keep the notebooks and data for the Data Institute together.

You will now have all the teaching data subsets that will be used in the NEON
Data Institute 2018.
