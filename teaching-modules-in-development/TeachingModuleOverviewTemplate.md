## NEON Data Skills Teaching Module Template

Given the differences in classrooms & instructor preferences, teaching modules 
can come in all different shapes and sizes. The most important part is that the 
teaching module documentation allows other instructors to implement or adapt the 
module for their use.  

Given the wide audience of instructors that can discover the materials and the 
possibility to "fork" educational resources on QUBES to show different iterations 
for different regions or themes, we encourage authors to publish their classroom 
content on QUBESHub.  

The the instructor can submit a Teaching Module overview page to 
neondataskills@BattelleEcology.org and (after review) it can be posted on the 
NEON site with links to the QUBESHub content.

### Components of a Teaching Module 

Teaching modules can be created in different ways, therefore we do not prescribe 
a specific format.  However, the following components are frequently included 
in a teaching module. 

* Instructor Notes: this can include an overview of the activity, directions to implement it, ways to address common student misconceptions, possible discussion questions, areas where challenges frequently occur, and other relevant information. 
* Learning Objectives: Consider using Bloom’s Taxonomy in writing these. 
* Student instructions/handouts
* Dataset or directions to access dataset
* Assessment suggestions: How can instructors assess learning objectives in this module. 
* Code or example spreadsheet
